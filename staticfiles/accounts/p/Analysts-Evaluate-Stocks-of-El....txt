Analysts Evaluate Stocks of Electric Utilities On Ability to Diversify, Compete With Rivals
When it comes to the factors that influence electric-utility stocks, interest rates may be only half the story.</br></br>Utility stocks have been in the dumps this year, mainly because rising interest rates make their dividends seem less attractive and increase their financing costs. But William F. Klausing, senior vice president of Irving Trust's public utilities division, argues that "interest rates are less important today than years ago in analyzing" utility stocks. "It's a whole new ballgame," he adds.</br></br>Mr. Klausing's point, echoed by some analysts, is that, after many years of multibillion dollar construction programs, utilities no longer borrow large amounts to build new plants because such investments appear too risky politically. Hence, the expenses of utilities have become less sensitive to interest rates.</br></br>To be sure, state regulators are trimming utilities' authorized rates of return -- and hence their profit potential -- in response to interest rate declines in the past few years. But, analysts note, many utilities have become units of holding companies. Profit from these publicly traded firms' non-regulated operations -- and from sales of electricity in the wholesale or bulk-power market -- have become important to a company's overall profitability.</br></br>So what should the savvy investor look for in an electric-utility stock?
