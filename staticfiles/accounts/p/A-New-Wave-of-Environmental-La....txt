A New Wave of Environmental Laws Looms
Jan. 20, 1989 will mark the onset of a flood of new health, safety and environmental regulation that will swamp that of the early 1970s. Impossible? Didn't regulation dry up in 1980 with Ronald Reagan's mandate to "get the government off our backs"? To be sure, Watt, Burford & Co. attempted to curtail regulation, or at least to cork the flow. But they soon departed as liabilities, leaving the agencies with "technocrat" administrators and instructions not to antagonize either the public or business.</br></br>For six years Mr. Reagan has focused on taxes, the budget deficit and defense expenditures. Inattention has not solved the health and environmental problems. Six years of accumulating pressure is about to explode: The majority of Americans continue to want something done about toxic waste dumps, water quality, air pollution and occupational hazards.</br></br>No one should doubt the political appeal of these issues. Congress delayed adjournment and campaigning for reelection to pass the Superfund and Drinking Water Acts. Overwhelming majorities voted for laws that will impose major costs, that could be used to halt industry and that will do little to improve health or the environment. The bills focus on unrealistic worst cases and hypothetical risks, and embody unattainable goals; they divert attention from pressing environmental problems such as radon in homes. Just before an election, Mr. Reagan could have tested his 1980 mandate, vetoing burdensome, unsound legislation. If he had, the Republican Senate was ready to override.</br></br>Separately, he did veto an egregious pork-barrel "clean water" bill that included sewer projects. It's a good bet Congress will put that one over the top when it reconvenes.</br></br>Looking ahead to 1988, will presidential candidates tell the voters in New Hampshire that Mr. Reagan was right to do nothing about acid rain except some ill-focused research? Who will say that the Reagan regulatory agencies have done such a good job that no further action need be taken on air pollution, drinking water, waste dumps, occupational health and safety, and nuclear power?
