After receding to around 1.8490 marks for about two hours, the dollar surged again in late trading to draw another reported round of intervention.</br></br>Some traders said the Fed's job was made difficult because of orders left on traders' books to buy dollars at 1.8500 marks, or just below. "At this point, they're just selling dollars to fill buy orders," one trader said.</br></br>A spokesman for the Fed would neither confirm nor deny reports that the central bank had intervened.</br></br>Late in the U.S. day, the dollar was quoted at 1.8508 marks, up from 1.8423 marks late Wednesday, and at 133.23 yen, up from 132.70 yen.
