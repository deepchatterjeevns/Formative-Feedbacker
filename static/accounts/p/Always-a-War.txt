Always a War
Brooding about the cataclysm of 1914 that shattered the long peace produced by the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Henry Kissinger wonders whether the protracted stability "might have contributed to disaster. For in the long interval of peace the sense of the tragic was lost."</br></br>America's sense of the tragic, never strong, may have been bleached away by the sunny blink of peace (peace enlivened by the gulf war) since the end of the Cold War. Or so it would seem from the widespread incomprehension of the conservative Congress's determination to spend more on defense than President Clinton desires.</br></br>Liberal critics say this determination reflects the reflexive militarism of the right, or traditional pork barrel politics with the defense budget. Although undoubtedly some supporters of augmented defense spending are doing the right thing for the wrong reasons, it is the right thing.</br></br>But it is not actually an increase in defense spending. Rather, the administration's defense cutting -- speaking of reflexive policies -- is being slowed. The Pentagon may receive about $7 billion more than the president wants, but that will merely hold the fiscal 1996 defense decline to 1.7 percent. And fiscal 1996 will be the 11th consecutive year of real (inflation-ad\justed) decline in defense spending.</br></br>Furthermore, although conservatives are generally disposed to prune government, it is hardly a behavioral anomaly for them to favor slowing the erosion of funding for the federal government's foremost responsibility. The contrast between liberal and conservative mentalities is especially sharp regarding defense, which touch\es core convictions about men and nations.
