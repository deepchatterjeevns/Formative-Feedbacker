Americas --- Above the U.S.: Canadian stocks last year outperformed the U.S. and most of Europe; We're talking a lot more than `rocks and trees'
It isn't often that Canadians get to boast about having one of the world's top-performing stock markets, but hot technology and communications stocks have put Canadian indexes in the limelight.</br></br>Though Asian markets generally fared even better last year, Canada handily outperformed the U.S. and most of Europe. Many investors still think of Canada's stock market as a play on natural resources. However, surging shares of such high-tech names as Nortel Networks Corp., BCE Inc. and JDS Uniphase Corp. (with headquarters in both San Jose, Calif., and Nepean, Ontario) have pushed Canada's traditional sectors into the shadows over the past year.</br></br>Technology and communications stocks accounted for about 51% of the weighting of the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index at the end of the first quarter. That compared with a weighting of just 15% for all of Canada's energy, mining and forest-products companies. Though some high-tech stocks have since plunged amid the sector's wobbles, telecom-equipment giant Nortel has seen its shares hold up well in the wake of strong earnings.</br></br>The weighting of Canada's resource stocks in the TSE 300 has long been declining as commodity producers disappointed investors and companies in other fields prospered. The combined weighting of resource companies has fallen from 20% two years ago and 29% a decade ago.</br></br>Over the past six months or so, many foreign investors "have woken up to the fact that there's much more going on here than rocks and trees," says George Vasic, market strategist with Bunting Warburg Dillon Read Inc. in Toronto. Mr. Vasic says the TSE 300's heavy weighting in technology stocks makes it "perhaps the second-greatest tech index" behind the tech-drenched Nasdaq Composite Index in the U.S.
