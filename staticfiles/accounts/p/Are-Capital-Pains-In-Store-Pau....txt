Are Capital Pains In Store?; Paulson's Plan For Fannie, Freddie Comes With Pitfalls
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's non-nationalization nationalization plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac sought to quell concerns over the firms' funding and capital.</br></br>On the first score, the rescue effort engineered along with the Federal Reserve seems to have done the trick -- at least for now. By aiming to give Fannie and Freddie access to the Fed's discount window and saying the government would expand lines of credit, Mr. Paulson made clear the stock market's loss of confidence wouldn't hamper the firms from issuing debt.</br></br>Indeed, Freddie sold a short-term debt issue as planned Monday. The cost of insuring against default on Fannie's and Freddie's senior debt also fell.</br></br>But questions about capital haven't gone away. That is why the Paulson plan said the Treasury could take some sort of direct equity stake in the firms.</br></br>The plan, which Congress must approve, was vague on details. What's unfortunate for existing shareholders is that the options for how it might play out likely will entail further pain.
