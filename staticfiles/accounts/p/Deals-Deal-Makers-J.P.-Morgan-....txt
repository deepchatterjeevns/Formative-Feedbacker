Deals & Deal Makers: J.P. Morgan Chase Unit Seeks Investors For a $13 Billion Private-Equity Fund
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., already the biggest lender in the private-equity arena, wants to launch a $13 billion private-equity fund that would be the largest ever of its kind.</br></br>The bank's private-equity investing division, once known as Chase Capital Partners and now called J.P. Morgan Partners, is looking for $5 billion of capital from outside investors such as pension funds, endowments and foundations, and will commit $8 billion of its own cash, according to the fund's confidential offering memorandum. Chase's prospective contribution is believed to be the biggest sum ever contributed to a single private-equity fund by any individual organization.</br></br>If the bank is successful in raising the money, the new fund, dubbed the Chase Capital Global 2001 Fund LP, would dwarf not only the growing multitude of venture-capital funds with $1 billion to $2 billion ready to invest but even Thomas Lee's just-raised $6.1 billion buyout fund, now the largest private-equity fund. Private-equity funds invest in leveraged buyouts, start-up companies and other kinds of private deals. A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan Chase declined to discuss the fund or comment on it.</br></br>Raising capital for the new fund could be rough, despite J.P. Morgan Chase's strong track record of annualized returns of 40%. The bank's plan comes at a time when rounding up investors for such initiatives has become much tougher.</br></br>Backing hot technology companies produced eye-popping returns for many private-equity firms in the late 1990s and early last year. Those funds then used those high double-digit or triple-digit returns as a way to persuade institutional investors to boost allocations to private equity.
