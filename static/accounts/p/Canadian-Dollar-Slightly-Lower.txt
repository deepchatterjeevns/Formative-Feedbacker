Canadian Dollar Slightly Lower
TORONTO--The Canadian dollar was slightly lower against its U.S. counterpart late Tuesday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled his support for continuing the Fed's easy money policies.</br></br>The U.S. dollar was at C$1.0263 late Tuesday, from C$1.0260 late Monday, according to data provider CQG.</br></br>Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. dollar traded at a new seven-month high against the Canadian dollar, as Mr. Bernanke reiterated his commitment to the Fed's bond-buying program, arguing that the benefits of stimulus still outweigh the risks. But the greenback's gains proved short-lived.</br></br>Such bond-buying programs, quantitative easing as they are known, are generally seen as corrosive to a currency, because they are viewed in the market as printing money.</br></br>Mr. Bernanke, delivering day one of his two-day testimony on monetary policy to Congress, defended the Fed's open-ended bond-buying program, saying the associated risks don't outweigh the benefit of "promoting a stronger economic recovery and more-rapid job creation."
