Credit markets: Price of 30-year Treasury bond moves higher after Greenspan hints at 'pre-emptive' rate rise
NEW YORK -- Investors bought 30-year bonds and sold shorter-dated Treasury securities yesterday as Wall Street became more convinced that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week.</br></br>The catalyst was fresh congressional testimony from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan, who reiterated his view that monetary policy should be "pre-emptive" to keep inflation in check.</br></br>In trading yesterday, the price of the bellwether 30-year bond was up 12/32 point, or $3.75 for a bond with $1,000 face value, at 95 25/32. Its yield fell to 6.95% from 6.98% late Wednesday, as bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices. Yet yields of shorter-dated bills and notes generally rose. The two-year note's yield, for example, climbed to 6.24% from 6.20%.</br></br>Mr. Greenspan credited low inflation with sustaining the nation's economic expansion, adding that "these types of results are why we stressed in our monetary policy testimony the importance of acting promptly -- ideally pre-emptively -- to keep inflation low over the immediate term and to promote price stability over time." The Fed chairman delivered a similar message to Congress in mid-February.</br></br>His comments yesterday bolstered the majority view that the Federal Open Market Committee on Tuesday will raise the Federal Funds target rate to 5.50% from 5.25%, where it has stood since January 1996. Economists at several Wall Street firms were moved to drop their forecasts for no rate change and instead predict a tightening.
