Buchanan Gets Response In Hard-Hit N.H. Area
Republican challenger Patrick J. Buchanan brought his angry, insurgent message today to a hard-hit region of New Hampshire that is responding to his invitation to "send a message" to President Bush.</br></br>In this community, which in 1988 had one of the lowest levels of unemployment in the nation but now has one of the highest in this recession-scarred state, many of the small businessmen attending a Chamber of Commerce gathering said they are strongly inclined, if not committed, to back the tough-talking Buchanan, and to abandon past loyalty to Bush.</br></br>"You have to have someone tough enough to stand up to the Democrats in Congress," said 35-year-old accountant Roger Marceau. Marceau was one of eight chamber members interviewed after Buchanan spoke, each one of them virtually certain they will support the columnist.</br></br>In contrast to working-class voters who are drawn under economic pressure to the Democratic Party, the small businessmen and women here were unanimous in their view that government spending is eating up private sector resources, and taxes - particularly the 1986 tax bill ending the deduction for consumer interest - have severely undermined the economy.</br></br>"I won't quit and I won't compromise," Buchanan said. "I will fight. There is no way you can defeat a Democratic Congress . . . if you will not fight for conservative and Republican principles. {I will tell Congress} `You don't think I have the authority to cut this pork barrel out, take me to the Supreme Court.'
