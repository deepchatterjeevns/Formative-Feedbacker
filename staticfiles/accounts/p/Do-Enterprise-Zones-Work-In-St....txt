Do Enterprise Zones Work? In St. Louis, Results Are Tepid
Manchester Avenue runs through the center of this city like a purple bruise. Once a busy commercial strip, the street is now studded with junked storefronts and hollowed-out brick buildings bearing signs with one plaintive word: "Available."</br></br>Joe Nehmen, whose grocery warehouse is just around the corner from Manchester Avenue, jabs his index finger between the steel bars of his front door, pointing out across the broken pavement to a squat little building across the street. "They just renovated that one," he says. "See that one over there?" he asks, pointing in another direction. "There's a developer who's interested in it. I mean it when I say this neighborhood is coming back."</br></br>Nehmen's observation seems more the expression of hope than hard facts. There are indeed a few signs of life left in this neighborhood-some warehouses, the refurbished Jefferson Printing Co. plant, a corner Jiffy Lube franchise, for example. But its general character remains threadbare and shabby. Most of the buildings here are more than 80 years old, and show their age, and many business and residents have abandoned the area for newer facilities and better housing in the suburbs. Just across from Nehmen's warehouse sits a huge, multistory office building occupied by just one tenant.</br></br>Six years ago, the state of Missouri began an effort to reverse the decline of Manchester Avenue and the 200 or so blocks surrounding it. The neighborhood was one of the first in the country to be declared a state enterprise zone, which gave businesses that moved into or expanded in this part of town special state tax breaks, such as credits for hiring workers or investing in plant and equipment.</br></br>The idea-which has been adopted in varying forms by 37 states and the District of Columbia-is receiving new attention on Capitol Hill, where five proposals are before Congress to establish a federal version of the enterprise-zone programs that the states have adopted.
