Despite Weak Yuan, Other Asia Currencies May Rally, Help U.S.
CHINA MAY NOT be the only player in the Asian currency game.</br></br>With U.S. business -- and American policy makers -- still smarting from Beijing's decision to put off any currency adjustment, there's evidence that other Asian currencies could soon be moving up, which would be good news for many U.S. corporations.</br></br>For American companies complaining that an artificially weak yuan harms their competitiveness in China, a rally in other Asian currencies would ease their pain by boosting profits throughout the fast-growing Pacific Rim region.</br></br>In a new report, Merrill Lynch & Co. argues that a currency shift beyond China could well be underfoot. As economic growth picks up, Asian central banks should be less worried that a stronger currency will harm their exports, and could feel less pressure to intervene.</br></br>The report also points to incipient signs of inflation in Asia, which would make stronger currencies more palatable. And despite this week's rebuff from Beijing, speculation that China will adjust its currency peg sometime next year -- allowing the yuan to strengthen -- is expected to boost other Asian currencies in anticipation.
