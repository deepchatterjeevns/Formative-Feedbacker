Dollar Ends Mixed As Action by Fed Eagerly Awaited ---- Special to The Wall Street Journal
NEW YORK -- The dollar was mixed as foreign exchange traders generally pushed it higher despite concerns the Federal Reserve might ease credit.</br></br>While traders and economists agreed the May producer price index figures, released yesterday, leave plenty of room for the Fed to push down interest rates, the data weren't compelling enough that the Fed would be forced to ease.</br></br>Hedging against the outside chance of a slight producer price rise of about 0.1% on the month, the market took short-dollar positions Wednesday and early yesterday, traders said. When Labor Department data showed the index rose 0.3%, higher than the consensus forecast of 0.2%, they squared their positions, lifting the dollar.</br></br>But no one was ready to take any big risks with the key U.S. data scheduled for release today, traders said.</br></br>Late in New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6935 marks, up from 1.6865 marks late Wednesday. The U.S. currency also was changing hands at 154.17 yen, down from 154.75 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.7080, below $1.7115.
