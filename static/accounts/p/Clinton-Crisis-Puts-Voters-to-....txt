Clinton Crisis Puts Voters to the Test --- Economic Well-Being, Mistrust of Politics Leave Public Averse to Big Change --- Among Factors That Influence People's Lives, Politics Ranks Toward Bottom --- Elected Officials Get Little Credit For the Economy
Joliet, Ill. -- In this blue-collar city, both political parties will spend the fall vying for the attention and affection of citizens like Carol Rapcan.</br></br>They will have to take a number and stand in line.</br></br>Even as the presidential sex scandal fills the front pages, Ms. Rapcan says lots of things are more important to her life than national politics. At age 55, she devotes much energy to her three daughters. She is also focused on the good economy. A busy bridal-shop owner is practically begging her to come and do alterations. At her regular job -- working the gift shop at Harrah's casino in town -- Ms. Rapcan watches as more and more people line up to spend their extra cash.</br></br>And in the past couple of years, something else has grabbed her by the heart: "Religion and the Lord," Ms. Rapcan says, clasping her hands together. Twice a week, she drives more than an hour to church. Last week, the sermon was on forgiveness. The week before, it was about seeing the good in everyone. Ms. Rapcan says she gets a lot more out of those messages than out of anything politicians can do for her.</br></br>Apparently, she is one of many who place politics far down on the list of things that influence their lives. In the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, the bulk, or 48% of people surveyed, say developments in medicine and health care affect their lives a "great deal." About 46% feel the nation's moral values affect their lives a lot. And as the stock market dives and soars, 33% say the market and conditions of the country have a big personal impact.
