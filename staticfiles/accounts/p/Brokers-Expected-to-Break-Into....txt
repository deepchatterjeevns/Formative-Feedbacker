Brokers Expected to Break Into Black in 2nd Quarter --- But Net May Be Down Significantly From '89
NEW YORK -- After six months in the red, the nation's brokerage firms finally eked out a profit in the second quarter, analysts say.</br></br>But earnings are hardly rosy for the beleaguered brokerage houses. Second-quarter profits, although an improvement over the two previous quarters, will be down as much as 35% from year-earlier levels when they are announced later this month, some analysts say.</br></br>"Profitability for a lot of the firms is still poor," says Alison Deans, a brokerage analyst at Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</br></br>Still, even meager profits will be a welcome relief for the 350 New York Stock Exchange broker-dealers doing business with the public. As a group, the brokerage firms had a pretax loss of $91.7 million in last year's fourth quarter -- the first industrywide loss since the quarter that included the 1987 stock-market crash.</br></br>And the Big Board is expected to soon report that in the 1990 first quarter, the 350 broker-dealers had a $486 million pretax loss, in part due to a surge in interest rates, industry executives say.
