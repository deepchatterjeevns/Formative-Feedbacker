Adobe to Acquire Frame For $500 Million in Stock --- Publishing-Software Firm Posts 96% Rise in Profit For the Second Quarter
Adobe Systems Inc., continuing to expand its electronic-publishing franchise, agreed to buy Frame Technology Inc. in a stock swap valued at $500 million.</br></br>Adobe, which also reported a 96% jump in second-quarter earnings, said the acquisition will augment its software products for creating documents and distributing them electronically. It offered 0.52 Adobe share for each Frame share, indicating a value of about $34 a share based on Adobe's closing price yesterday.</br></br>The agreement was announced after the close of trading. Frame's shares closed at $26.75, up 50 cents, on the Nasdaq Stock Market, and Adobe shares rose $2.125 to $65.50. In after-market trading, however, Adobe's shares traded as low as $62, according to Jeffries & Co. Some analysts labeled the price too rich, in view of Frame's size and profitability.</br></br>"It looks to me that Adobe is just trying to own everything that has to do with publishing," said Russell Crabs, an analyst at Soundview Financial Group. "But not everything in the publishing market has high value."</br></br>Adobe, based in Mountain View, Calif., pioneered the market for desktop-publishing programs, including software called PostScript that is used in laser printers. Last year, it swapped about $450 million in stock to buy Aldus Corp. of Seattle. Most of Adobe's products work on Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh system or PCs that use Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system. Lately, the company has been pushing to make its software a standard for distributing documents over the Internet.
