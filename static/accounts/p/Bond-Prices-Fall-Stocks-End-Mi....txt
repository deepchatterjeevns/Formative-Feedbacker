Bond Prices Fall; Stocks End Mixed --- Fed Rate Statement Prompts a Tumble In Dormant Market

The dollar was mixed.</br></br>The bond market, practically dormant through much of the morning, began churning once the Fed said at midafternoon that it had raised interest rates. But as economists read through the Federal Open Market Committee statement on the move, bond prices began to slump, especially among shorter-term issues.</br></br>Some economists noted that not only did the Fed increase the federal funds rate by 0.50%, but also the discount rate by the same margin. The fed funds rate is the bank overnight lending rate and the discount rate is the rate the Fed charges from its discount window. In addition to the rate boosts, the Fed termed signs of slowing as "tentative" and hinted that the economy remains quite vigorous, even as it raised rates for the seventh time in about one year.</br></br>The language that accompanied the Fed's move, especially about inflation and capacity utilization, along with the unanimous vote, telegraphed a certain sense of concern to the bond market," said Frazier Evans, senior economist for Colonial Investment Services.</br></br>In the stock market, a mild rally in cyclical issues rapidly escalated into a fierce argument between the two warring constituencies seeking control of the stock market. During the past two sessions, more than 800 million shares have traded hands as investors have wrestled with the recession question.
