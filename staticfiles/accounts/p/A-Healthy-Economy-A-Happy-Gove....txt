A Healthy Economy, A Happy Governor
Good economies make good politics. That's what Gov. Parris N. Glendening is finding as he stumps the state, touting rosy revenue and employment statistics while his opponents grumble and try to change the subject.</br></br>Last week in Baltimore, Glendening (D) spoke before hundreds of people at the 14th annual Small Business Awards Breakfast. He briefly highlighted his administration's accomplishments, then added a bit of news: Maryland's unemployment rate had fallen to 4.6 percent, the lowest level in years and somewhat below the national average of 5 percent.</br></br>"Unemployment was down in every single jurisdiction in this state," the governor said. Sitting seven seats to Glendening's left at the head table was Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke (D), who last month defected from the governor's camp and endorsed a rival for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. And quietly sitting at another table, nearly lost in the huge hotel ballroom, was that very candidate: Harford County Executive Eileen M. Rehrmann.</br></br>Schmoke followed Glendening at the microphone and noted that Rehrmann and a few other elected officials were in the audience. He also praised the state economy and added: "This breakfast is also a tribute to our country."</br></br>As Schmoke walked back to his chair, Glendening rose and shook his hand. The two men spoke quietly as the program continued, then parted with big smiles.
