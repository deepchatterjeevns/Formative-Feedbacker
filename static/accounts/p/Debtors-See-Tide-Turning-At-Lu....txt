Debtors See Tide Turning At Lucky Worcester Court
WORCESTER, Mass. -- For years, bankruptcy lawyer Paul Daley jokingly advised his Boston clients to "get a phone booth in Worcester" if they ever had to seek protection from creditors.</br></br>That way, they would have an address here and be able to file through the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Worcester, before Judge James F. Queenan Jr., a man whose reputation for debtor-friendly decisions has helped to draw cases from Boston and even other states. During the recession-induced bankruptcy boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Judge Queenan's court served as Chapter 11 Heaven, and since he was the only bankruptcy judge sitting in the western district of Massachusetts, petitioners who filed in Worcester had 100% certainty of drawing him.</br></br>Then came Judge Henry J. Boroff. And bankruptcy lawyers say nothing has been 100% certain since.</br></br>Brought in by an overworked Judge Queenan four years ago, Judge Boroff has gradually gained a reputation as being hard on debtors -- becoming, in effect, the anti-Queenan.</br></br>"While both judges are perceived as being fair and intelligent," says Joseph H. Baldiga, a bankruptcy specialist with Mirick O'Connell in Worcester, "the perception is that Judge Boroff may not be as debtor-friendly."
