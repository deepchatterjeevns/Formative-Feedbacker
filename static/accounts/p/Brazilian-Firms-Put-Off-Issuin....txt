Brazilian Firms Put Off Issuing Debt as Lenders Stiffen Terms
SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Some of Brazil's biggest companies have postponed plans to borrow on international debt markets, as lending terms stiffen and foreign investors back off.</br></br>Several large electric utilities have postponed dollar-denominated debt issues, and firms including cellular and media concerns are looking to local markets and bank loans to finance their operations and repay maturing debt.</br></br>"A new [international] issue just won't happen right now," says Robert Nydegger, a Latin America corporate credit analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. "The cost of debt is just way too expensive."</br></br>The interest rate on Brazilian corporate bonds has jumped by about two percentage points over the past two months, raising bond yields for some blue-chip companies to nearly 16%. The recent half-percentage-point rate rise by the U.S. Federal Reserve was the breaking point for some companies, whose foreign borrowing rates are priced according to U.S. Treasury bonds.</br></br>Fresh from a four-city roadshow in the U.S. and Europe, electric utility Light Servicios de Eletricidade SA last week postponed a $150 million bond sale following the Fed move. A person familiar with the issue, who says Light was also following the whipsaw movements of the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, says investors who had tentatively agreed to accept a rate of 9.75% were suddenly demanding payments as high as 11%.
