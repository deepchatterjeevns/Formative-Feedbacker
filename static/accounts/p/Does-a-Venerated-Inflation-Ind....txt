Does a Venerated Inflation Index Get the Price Right?
When most interest rates turned upward late last year, the standard explanation among financial market analysts was that investors thought stronger U.S. economic growth would increase demand for credit and push up inflation. To protect themselves against erosion of the value of their money, investors were requiring that borrowers pay them higher rates.</br></br>Among the many reasons analysts cited for their expectation of higher inflation, one was common to nearly all of them: the persistent rise in the CRB futures price index.</br></br>That index, calculated daily by the Commodity Research Bureau, covers a basket of commodities whose futures contracts are traded on various commodity exchanges. As the chart at the right shows, the CRB index fell during the 1990-91 recession and finally hit bottom nearly a year ago. Since then it has risen about 15 percent, though it is still below its pre-recession level.</br></br>The CRB index is the most closely watched of all commodity indexes, but this time it may be giving a misleading signal about future inflation.</br></br>As a counterpoint, some analysts cite a different commodity index that is shown in the other line on the chart - and that one tells a very different story.
