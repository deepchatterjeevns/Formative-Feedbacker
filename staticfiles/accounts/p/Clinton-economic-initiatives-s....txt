Clinton economic initiatives strengthen U.S. position as G-7 prepares to meet
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has a greatly strengthened hand as Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen heads to London for tomorrow's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the seven largest industrialized nations.</br></br>In his first meeting with his counterparts from the other Group of Seven nations, Mr. Bentsen is almost certain to argue that the U.S. is finally doing what its allies have demanded: Raising taxes to shrink its budget deficit, helping to reduce pressure on world interest rates and ease inflationary fears.</br></br>In exchange, the U.S. is likely to argue, the Japanese and Germans should do their part to enhance the prospects for world economic growth. From Japan, the U.S. wants stepped-up government spending to stimulate its economy. And from Germany, it wants lower interest rates from the Bundesbank, which would probably require some fiscal belt-tightening by the German government.</br></br>"As I've talked to finance ministers from other parts of the world . . . they are impressed with what we have done," Mr. Bentsen told a congressional hearing this week. "I believe that puts us in a stronger leadership role when we get to deal with these other countries and trying to develop . . . sustained growth in other markets that will be buying our products."</br></br>Robert Hormats, a Clinton backer who is vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs International, says Mr. Bentsen goes to London "in the strongest position of any U.S. Treasury secretary in a G-7 meeting for a decade."
