Durable Goods Orders Lower Than Forecast
Orders for U.S. durable goods fell more than forecast in May, the first government economic report to cast doubt on the strength of the rebound in business investment.</br></br>Demand for goods meant to last several years fell 2.8 percent, the first drop in four months, after a revised 1.1 percent gain in April that was larger than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. Excluding transportation equipment, orders fell 1 percent.</br></br>The decline, led by fewer orders for aircraft, metals and machinery, spurred some economists to cut forecasts for economic growth this quarter. Federal Reserve policymakers, who predict faster economic expansion later this year, are forecast to keep interest rates unchanged when their two-day meeting ends today.</br></br>"The optimism about business spending maybe was a bit overdone," said Kevin Logan, senior market economist at Dresdner Kleinwort in New York. "The economic rebound will be pretty modest."</br></br>Economists forecast durable goods would fall 1 percent after a 0.8 percent rise reported earlier for April, according to the median of forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.
