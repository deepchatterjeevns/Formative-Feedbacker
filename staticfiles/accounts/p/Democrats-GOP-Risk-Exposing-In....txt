Democrats, GOP Risk Exposing Internal Discord in Hunt for Economic Agendas
With the economy strong and the balanced-budget fight behind them, Democrats and Republicans find themselves groping for economic issues to argue about when they return to Washington this week.</br></br>Part of the problem, strategists from both parties acknowledge, is that economic issues simply don't stir voter passions when times are so good: when inflation is subdued, the jobless rate has fallen to a three-decade low and the stock market remains buoyant. Indeed, many economic policy entrepreneurs say they are writing off the next two years and instead are concentrating on ideas that will resonate in the 2000 presidential campaign.</br></br>Equally vexing, however, is that policy proposals being debated in both political camps seem as likely to highlight intra-party differences as to draw clear distinctions between Republicans and Democrats.</br></br>White House economic advisers, reflecting President Clinton's interest in securing his legacy, are pondering long-term challenges -- how to boost productivity through improvements in education, for example, or how to ensure lasting solvency for federal entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security. "It's one of those rare moments when you have a chance to step back and reflect on your fundamental priorities," said Gene Sperling, chairman of Clinton's National Economic Council.</br></br>But some congressional Democrats have more immediate concerns. Liberals, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), favor a return to traditional Democratic themes such as raising the minimum wage and urge more aggressive action by the government to close the gap between rich and poor.
