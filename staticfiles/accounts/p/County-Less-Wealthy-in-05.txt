County Less Wealthy in '05
The U.S. Census Bureau reported this week that Howard was the fifth-wealthiest county in the country, based on a median household income of $82,065 in 2004. That puts Howard just below Montgomery County, which had a median household income of $82,971 last year, according to the bureau's annual American Community Survey. The highest-ranked in the nation was Fairfax County, with a median household income of $88,133.</br></br>In the 2003 American Community Survey, Howard ranked second in the country for household income, at $88,555. In 2002, Howard was ranked fifth wealthiest, behind Montgomery and Fairfax. The survey is available at www.census.gov.</br></br>The effort to protect more farmland in the county is prompting "a fairly high anxiety level," Marsha S. McLaughlin, director of the Howard Department of Planning and Zoning, said this week.</br></br>McLaughlin told a newly appointed committee of west county landowners, developers, land-use lawyers and homebuilders that she hopes the group can strike a balance between protecting landowners' property rights and preserving more farmland.</br></br>The panel was assembled after western residents complained vigorously last month about the department's proposal to reduce residential density on land zoned "rural conservation." County officials worry they're losing too much prime farmland to development, so they want to make it less attractive to build there.
