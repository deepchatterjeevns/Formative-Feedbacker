An hour before stock market trading began, the Labor Department disclosed that the nation's struggling economy lost 117,000 jobs last month, instead of generating the 100,000 or so that most economists and analysts had expected.</br></br>The report touched off an immediate bond market rally, followed within minutes by the Fed's decision to cut the discount rate -- the rate the central bank charges member institutions for short-term loans -- to 3% from 3.5%.</br></br>Arthur Micheletti, chief market strategist at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, said the employment report yesterday may be a prelude to more bad news on the earnings front.</br></br>"The Fed's move is confirmation that the economic data are weaker than had been expected," he said.
