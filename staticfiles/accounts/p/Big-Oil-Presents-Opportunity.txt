Big Oil Presents Opportunity
The oil companies are giving Congress and the Bush administration a golden opportunity to regain some of their standing in the eyes of the voters. Big oil-which has never been a particularly good citizen-has overplayed its hand at the wrong time.</br></br>Within minutes, it seemed, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, oil prices had jumped at the local gasoline pumps. Never had so many understood so quickly the instant ramifications of an event on the other side of the world. The oil companies quickly seized the opportunity to raise prices so consumers were paying around 10 cents more a gallon by the end of last week than they were at the beginning of the week for gasoline that left the Middle East as crude oil months ago.</br></br>Experts say the United States has a three- to six-month reserve. The oil industry's standard response when its price increases are challenged is that it bases its prices on what it will cost to replace the reserves. Thus, with an renegade like Iraqi's Saddam Hussein controlling about 20 percent of the world's oil reserves the companies can pitch the argument that it will cost considerably more to replace stock.</br></br>But anyone who waited in gasoline lines in 1973 and, to a lesser extent, in 1979 had plenty of time to do some hard thinking about the oil industry's double talk about just how much oil was where and how much was being released and how much was being horded in hopes of obtaining even higher profits. Probably the one thing that never touches oil from the time it leaves the ground to the time it gets in your gas tank is a grain of truth about how much it costs.</br></br>The oil companies, with tentacles in virtually every aspect of the civilized world, have been able to call the shots in the modern industrial era with an arrogance that is unparalleled by any other industry and probably most governments. The United States, which is completely dependent on the oil companies as the source of industrial, home, and transportation energy, can't-or won't-stand up to them.
