Abreast of the market: Stock prices finish mostly lower in volatile, high-volume session
NEW YORK -- Inflation fears, soaring commodity prices, a bleak interest-rate outlook and concerns about the technology sector combined to send the stock market on dizzying spins throughout its busiest day in almost a month.</br></br>In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 5487.07, up just 1.09 points, while other major indexes finished lower. The session started with gains, as oversold conditions from the three-day sell-off that took 200 points off the Dow industrials sent blue chips on what looked to be a heartening rally.</br></br>But once the advance faltered, waves of sell programs sent the market spiraling lower, traders said. The choppy session saw the market twice trigger the New York Stock Exchange's 50-point "collar," bringing to 41 the number of times that curbs on certain program trading have kicked in this year.</br></br>Jeffrey Applegate, chief market strategist at Lehman Brothers, said investors' confused, sometimes conflicting takes on the state of the economy have contributed to the volatility in the market.</br></br>"This lack of consensus [about the strength of the economy] creates opportunities to make these kinds of sharp changes in trading patterns, because there is less conviction in the trades themselves," Mr. Applegate said.
