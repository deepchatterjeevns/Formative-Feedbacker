ECB May Need to Sail In the Wake of the Fed
FRANKFURT -- No matter what rhetoric it uses, the European Central Bank has to keep raising interest rates in lockstep with the U.S. Federal Reserve -- or risk an even sharper decline to the already sinking euro. With the U.S economy growing so strongly and signs of inflation beginning to emerge, the Fed is firmly on the path toward higher U.S. interest rates. That puts strong pressure on the ECB to lift European rates -- even beyond what is necessary to control European growth pressures.</br></br>For some of the smaller ECB member countries, this is an ironic change of circumstances. In the years prior to the formation of the ECB, less economically advanced countries often complained of being held hostage to the monetary policy of Germany's powerful Bundesbank, over which they had no say. Germany was, and still is, the major economic power in Europe and to remain on a level playing field with Germany, other central banks had to follow the Bundesbank's lead.</br></br>But with the ECB, the rest of Europe thought they would finally have a voice. Instead, they now feel they're hostage to Alan Greenspan.</br></br>The euro, the shared currency of 11 nations, has lost 24% of its value against the dollar since its inception in January 1999. For many reasons, global investors appear to prefer to put money in the U.S. instead of Europe, and the European currency is suffering as a result.</br></br>To name a few: ever-stronger economic reports from the U.S. and relatively weaker performance of Europe; the magnetic U.S. stock market; political uncertainty in Italy; the likelihood of highly indebted Greece, though economically insignificant, joining the euro next year; the investigation of Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the Bank of France and heir apparent to the ECB president, for possible wrongdoings when he was in the French treasury; the inability of Deutsche Bank AG and Dresdner Bank AG to pull off a merger; and the resignation of the European Commission's executive body last year. Wim Duisenberg, the ECB's president, even listed the Balkan war as a reason for the euro's mysterious decline.
