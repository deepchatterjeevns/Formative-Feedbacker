Dow Closes Up 10 in Mixed Trading
Stock prices ended mixed today as Wall Street waited for remarks this week by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before the Senate Banking Committee.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 10.43 points at 3963.97. Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange; trading volume fell to 308.1 million shares from Friday's 347.98 million. Financial markets were closed Monday for Presidents' Day.</br></br>Broader market indicators also were mixed. The Nasdaq index ended down 2.35 points to 784.62 and the American Stock Exchange index was off 0.09 to 447.51. But the NYSE composite index edged up 0.15 to 261.98 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.77 to 482.74.</br></br>Traders attributed the rally in blue-chip stocks to the reversal of some of Friday's options-related selling that wiped out 34 points from the Dow average.</br></br>Analysts said most investors saw few incentives to get involved ahead of congressional testimony on Wednesday by Greenspan. Traders will be looking for hints on the direction of the Fed's monetary policy.
