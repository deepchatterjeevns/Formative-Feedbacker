A Budget Surplus Certainly Is Fun -- While It Lasts
ARE YOU ENJOYING the budget surplus? Let's hope so; it's disappearing right before your eyes.</br></br>Nearly everybody in Washington is playing a part in making it evaporate. That isn't what you'll see in the authorized budget numbers, of course. But many of those numbers are at best suspect, and at worst part of a game that makes it easier for both parties to do what they want for short-term political reasons, while ignoring problems that are being sown for the long run.</br></br>Why this gloomy analysis now? Because three troubling trend lines are coming together. First, it's increasingly clear that the tax-cut bill recently passed by Congress and signed by President Bush, while reasonable enough at its advertised size, has enough tricks and omissions in its details that its true effect on the budget is understated, perhaps by hundreds of billions of dollars.</br></br>Second, Congress and the administration have put the tax cut within a 10-year spending plan that an optimist would call extremely ambitious -- and a skeptic would call wholly unrealistic. It anticipates Congress somehow will keep spending increases for the next decade to roughly half the average of the last couple of years -- and that the Bush administration won't weigh in with big new defense-spending or substantial emergency-spending requests.</br></br>Third, both parties in Congress already are showing in real life why such plans are at risk. President Bush's own Republicans are busy adding back into spending bills for next year items the White House doesn't want, pleasing fans of apple programs and water projects but undermining budget blueprints.
