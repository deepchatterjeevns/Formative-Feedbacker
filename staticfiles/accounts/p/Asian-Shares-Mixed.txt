Asian Shares Mixed
Asian markets were mixed early Friday as supportive comments from German Chancellor Angela Merkel helped sentiment.</br></br>Ms. Merkel said Germany is "committed do everything we can in order to maintain the common currency." Her comments were seen as supporting European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro.</br></br>The euro was at $1.2355, stabilizing after climbing 0.6% overnight--the single currency's first climb in three sessions.</br></br>The yen was also in focus. It was at 79.27 to the dollar early Friday. The dollar strengthened against the Japanese currency overnight, at one point hitting a five-week high of Y79.40 as the positive sentiment weakened the desire to move into Asia's safe-haven currency and some investors became less confident that the U.S. Federal Reserve will launch another round of monetary stimulus.</br></br>The weaker yen remained a support for Japan's Nikkei, which was up 0.4% early Friday with steelmakers and brokerages leading the gains.
