Curry Offers Increase In Budget for Schools; Board Wants More for Smaller Classes
Prince George's County Executive Wayne K. Curry yesterday proposed increasing school spending by $59 million, which would fund a teachers' raise, two new elementary schools and about 40 new guidance counselors.</br></br>The $1 billion school spending plan was a key part of Curry's annual budget presentation, a proposal he touted for containing none of the service cuts or tax increases contemplated in neighboring areas.</br></br>"That's a whole lot of zeroes," Curry (D) said at a news conference in Upper Marlboro, referring to the money for schools.</br></br>Nevertheless, the school increase was far less than the $158 million boost that Board of Education officials had requested. And Curry's proposal contained no money to reduce class sizes, something that Schools Superintendent Iris T. Metts listed as her top priority.</br></br>Curry said it would be unwise to spend money on hiring more teachers to cut class sizes when there isn't enough classroom space. But school board members, who had requested $11.5 million for the initiative, say it can be accomplished by assigning two teachers to a single class.
