A Cheap Dollar Boom
Discussing the falling dollar at a panel of the World Economic Forum here, a former U.S. senator said the greenback's decline was just a blip. The abiding fact was that for more than a century, in good times and bad, the world's investors have been in love with the American economy. And that ardor continues today.</br></br>Yes, responded a Chinese economist, but "love affairs always end." And, he might have added, new infatuations always begin -- as now seems to be the case with the Chinese economy.</br></br>Their exchange framed two key themes of this year's annual meeting of global economic leaders: first, the remarkable durability of the U.S. economy, which is surging again this year even though the dollar is weak, just as it did in the late 1990s, when the dollar was strong; and, second, the inexorable rise of China as a global economic superpower.</br></br>U.S. economic strength is probably the most important fact in this election year. On paper, the Bush administration's economic policies may seem profligate and potentially ruinous. But there was a consensus among business executives here that the falling dollar has been good for the U.S. economy. The cheaper dollar will stimulate demand for U.S. exports abroad and (in theory at least) reduce America's demand for imports. That should gradually lower the towering trade deficit.</br></br>The mood was upbeat even at a panel titled "What if the Dollar Declines Another 20 Percent?" The biggest worry was how a plummeting dollar would affect other economies. A former senior official of the Federal Reserve predicted a global redistribution of demand toward the United States and away from rising currencies such as the euro.
