But competition from casinos and an aging fan base have slowed horse racing's growth in the past two years, and the industry is scrambling to put the sport online in hopes of attracting a young and growing Web-savvy market.</br></br>In the past few years, track owners, gambling companies and entrepreneurs have launched a half-dozen major horse-racing Web sites.
