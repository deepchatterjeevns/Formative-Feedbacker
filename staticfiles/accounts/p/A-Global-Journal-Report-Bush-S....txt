A Global Journal Report: Bush Seeks to Use Backlash on Jobs As Lever on India
The Bush administration hopes to use the American backlash against job outsourcing to press India into concessions in other trade disputes, but New Delhi is resisting.</br></br>U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick challenged Indian officials to lower trade barriers as a strategy to help defuse the U.S. jobs-protection debate raging in Congress and American state capitals. To keep U.S markets open to India, New Delhi "has to open" its markets, he said.</br></br>The U.S. wants India to reduce its agricultural and industrial tariffs and quotas, liberalize its government-procurement rules and stiffen its intellectual-property protection. These have been longtime U.S. goals, but the Bush administration is betting India might be more amenable to doing so if it will stave off American legislative proposals to limit the flow of U.S. jobs to India.</br></br>Last year, trade between the two countries totaled $18 billion. India had an $8 billion trade surplus with the U.S. last year, a 50% increase from five years earlier.</br></br>The Senate put more muscle behind Mr. Zoellick's warning Thursday, when it approved a measure that would impose restrictions on government contractors to discourage companies from outsourcing American jobs overseas. The ban wouldn't apply to countries that have signed an international accord liberalizing government-procurement rules, but India and China haven't signed that pact.
