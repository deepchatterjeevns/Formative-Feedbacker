A Common Market -- The Public's Zeal to Invest --- Securities Blanket: How Joe Smith's Faith In the Market Mirrors The Passion of Millions --- He Proselytizes on the Virtues Of Long-Term Investing With Eye to Retirement --- Big Gains, but Big Risks, Too
[First in a Series]</br></br>MILLBURN, N.J. -- If there is an Everyman for the '90s, perhaps it is someone like Joe Smith, a mild-mannered marketing man who works for a big business that is owned by a bigger business.

(Between 1977 and 1990, Mr. Lynch earned a cumulative return of 2,703%, compared with 574% for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index.)</br></br>This belief, or something similar, is stirring ordinary investors across the land. Much as the 1980s were the decade of deal-making Henry Kravises, the '90s may go down as the time of Joe and Jane Smiths. Ordinary Americans have embraced the stock market -- it may be said that they are the stock market -- as never before. Roughly four of every 10 adults now, in at least a small way, are invested in the stock market. This is a seismic shift; in the 1960s, the figure was only two in 10.
