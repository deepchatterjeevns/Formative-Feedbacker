Caterpillar Posts Net for Quarter, Reversing Trend --- Firm Shows $24 Million Profit After 7 Quarterly Losses, But Avoids '84 Predictions
PEORIA, Ill. -- Caterpillar Tractor Co. said it regained profitability in the second quarter after seven consecutive quarterly losses, but it hedged on an earlier forecast of a profit for the full year.</br></br>The maker of construction equipment and engines also cut its capital spending plans 26% and lowered its sales outlook for 1984.</br></br>Caterpillar said it posted net income for the quarter of $24 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with a loss of $92 million a year earlier. Sales rose 49% to $1.83 billion from $1.23 billion. Earnings in the 1983 quarter were affected by a seven-month strike by the United Auto Workers union; the strike ended April 24, 1983.</br></br>While still expecting a significant increase in 1984 sales from last year's depressed levels, Caterpillar lowered its forecast because of a smaller-than-expected improvement in demand from U.S. energy sectors and rising interest rates. The company refused to issue specific numbers.</br></br>"We think we can be profitable for the year," a company spokesman said. "We aren't saying we will be profitable." Previously, Caterpillar had said it expected to post a profit for 1984.
