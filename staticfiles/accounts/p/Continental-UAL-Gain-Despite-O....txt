Continental, UAL Gain Despite Oil's Steep Gain
Small-cap consumer stocks climbed Thursday on some better-than- expected May sales reports, offsetting renewed concerns surrounding a return of rising oil prices.</br></br>Also helping stocks was a surprising drop in the number of jobless claims last week, as the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a six-week low, signaling some improvement in labor-market conditions ahead of Friday's employment report for May. As a result, key small-cap indexes closed at highs for 2008.</br></br>Leading the way for consumer stocks was teen retailer Buckle, which continues to report outsize increases. The company posted a 35% increase in May same-store sales; in the first four months of the year, the lowest growth was January's 19%. Buckle ended the day up $1.72, or 3.7%, at $48.57 on the New York Stock Exchange. Among other small-cap retailers posting better-than-expected May same-store sales, Cache rose 1.89, or 15%, to 14.59, while Hot Topic increased 89 cents, or 17%, to 6.16.</br></br>The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks climbed 19.56 points, or 2.63%, to 763.27, and the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 rose 9.34 points, or 2.38%, to 402.07, marking their biggest one-day gains since April 16. Both closed at their highest points this year.</br></br>The biggest one-day dollar increase in crude oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange did little to stop the momentum of consumer stocks, while driving several energy names higher. Within that sector, Swift Energy (NYSE) gained 3.66, or 6.4%, to 60.80.
