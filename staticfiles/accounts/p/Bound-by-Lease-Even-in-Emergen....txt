Bound by Lease, Even in Emergency
QI signed a one-year lease for an apartment when I came for college. My father was a co-signer on the lease because I don't have credit or a job.</br></br>My father has suffered a severe stroke, which has left him with almost no memory, impaired speech and mobility, and no job. I also received a letter from his neurologist telling me that I have to travel back home and take care of him because I am the only available family member -- my brother is in the military and cannot leave to take care of him.</br></br>I spoke with the people at the rental office, and they said the only way I could get away without paying any penalties for breaking the lease is if the apartment is rented. I'm okay with that, but the problem is that it could take months for them to rent it. Right now, with medical bills and unemployment, I can't afford to pay the rent, much less the rent plus penalty charges.</br></br>I need to know if I can legally break the lease because of the family emergency. The only reason I got the apartment was because of my father's signature. Is there anything I can do so that I may go and take care of my father and not have to keep paying rent?</br></br>I'm sorry to hear about your father, but I have to tell you that the information from the apartment managers is accurate. A lease is a legally binding document. Personal reasons or even severe health emergencies are not legal grounds to unilaterally terminate the lease without penalty or being responsible until the unit is rented.
