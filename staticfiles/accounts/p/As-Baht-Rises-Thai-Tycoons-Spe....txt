As Baht Rises, Thai Tycoons Spend
BANGKOK--Fifteen years ago, Thailand and other Asian countries let their currencies slide, using cheap exports to help lift them out of a devastating economic slump.</br></br>Today, Thailand's currency is soaring, and some of its tycoons are going on a buying spree.</br></br>As Japan has moved to drive down the yen to power up its own exports, billions of dollars in funds have flowed into Thailand and other emerging markets in search of higher yields. That is pushing up the value of local currencies against major global counterparts such as the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen. It also is giving businesses a new, and sometimes perplexing, opportunity: purchasing power.</br></br>The Thai baht has risen as much as 6% against the dollar since the beginning of the year and many economists predict further gains, leading some businessmen to reckon the best response is to borrow heavily in dollars to expand their businesses. Chief among them is Dhanin Chearavanont, who turned a seed business into Thailand's largest conglomerate, making himself the country's richest man in the process.</br></br>Earlier this year, the 74-year-old Mr. Dhanin completed the purchase of Chinese insurance firm Ping An for $9.4 billion. His Charoen Pokphand Group is now bidding $6.6 billion for Thai discount wholesaler Siam Makro in what is shaping up as another Asian megadeal.
