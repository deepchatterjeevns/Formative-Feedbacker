Crimson Blues: Harvard Clash Pits Entrenched Faculty Vs. Brusque Leader; Summers's Executive Style Hits Academic Roadblock; Board Digs In for Fight; A Firestorm Over Gender
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University's secretive seven-member governing board issued an unusual statement yesterday: It stands behind the school's president, Lawrence H. Summers.</br></br>The board's one-page letter to "the Harvard community" sets the stage for a possible showdown between Mr. Summers and his prominent faculty critics, who are moving toward a referendum on his leadership.</br></br>The immediate source of friction between Mr. Summers and the faculty was a talk he gave at a recent conference on work-force diversification -- statements that he finally made public yesterday -- but the roots of the clash run deeper.</br></br>Hired more than three years ago to retool Harvard for the 21st century, the former Treasury secretary has found the hierarchical management style common in corporations and cabinet agencies to be a tough fit for a storied university accustomed to decision making that is decentralized and collegial. The confrontation comes as more and more universities, pressed financially on several fronts, have turned to leaders with experience outside academia to reinvigorate their institutions -- and have in turn often met resistance from faculty.</br></br>The campus firestorm over Mr. Summers erupted last month when he made comments at a National Bureau of Economic Research conference here suggesting that innate gender differences could help explain why fewer women gain high-level academic careers in science and math. Prominent Harvard faculty and presidents of other elite universities spoke out publicly against his views.
