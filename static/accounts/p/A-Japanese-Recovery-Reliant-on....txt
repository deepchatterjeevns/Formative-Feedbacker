A Japanese Recovery Reliant on China
TOKYO -- Japan's tenuous recovery is relying more and more on a part of the world many Japanese view as their gravest economic threat: China.</br></br>That contrarian view was supported by data released yesterday. Japan's merchandise-trade surplus grew 1.1% in September from a year earlier, to 1.05 trillion yen ($8.43 billion), the seventh rise in as many months. Exports to China soared 40% in the month, the Finance Ministry said, driven by strong sales of semiconductors and cars. That outpaced the 3.8% rise in shipments to the U.S., Japan's largest market.</br></br>The nation's overall surplus barely grew, because imports by Japan rose faster than exports. More troubling, September's trade surplus fell a seasonally adjusted 2.3% from August. "Exports were weaker than expected," said J.P. Morgan economist Ryo Hino, and they are "clearly trending down."</br></br>The slackening expansion of the trade surplus is the latest sign that Japan's export-fueled recovery could run out of steam. Expanding the surplus is critical for the world's second-largest economy. The main potential drivers of growth -- spending by consumers and investment by businesses -- continue to slump amid poor corporate profits and pessimism over slipping wages and bleak job prospects.</br></br>Japan snapped a string of four quarterly contractions in its gross domestic product, its worst postwar recession, only after strong exports helped the economy expand at an annualized pace of 1.9% in the April-June quarter. Many economists say they expect Japan to start contracting again before year's end. The International Monetary Fund predicts Japan's GDP will shrink 0.5% in 2002 and grow 1.1% in 2003.
