Consumer Price Index in November Rose only 0.4%, Sparking Call for Rate Cut
WASHINGTON -- Of all the problems the economy has, inflation apparently isn't one of them.</br></br>November's consumer price index rose 0.4%, the Labor Department said. While that's higher than October's 0.1% increase, it doesn't challenge the view that inflation is relatively well-behaved.</br></br>A whitefly infestation in California caused produce prices to skyrocket -- lettuce prices leapt 44.5% -- as grocery store food prices rose 0.8% overall. Many economists feel that the food price jump, plus an increase in gasoline prices, overstated the November increase. The index's core rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, climbed just 0.3%.</br></br>The report sparked further calls for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates once more. The consumer price figures are "certainly not putting up any impediments" to further easing, said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the National Council of Savings Institutions. On the other hand, he added, the index alone won't be enough to induce a rate drop.</br></br>This year, the overall consumer price index has grown at a 2.9% annual rate, compared with 6.4% last year.
