Alliance Capital Leads the Pack Betting Heavily on Hedge Funds
Institutional money managers are targeting the hedge-fund business as a fee-rich growth area that can also help retain promising talent.</br></br>Leading the pack: Alliance Capital Management LP, the money-management company whose family of hedge funds already has $1.3 billion under management -- and is gunning for $2 billion by year end.</br></br>Hedge funds are private investment partnerships for qualified wealthy investors that often use borrowed funds to boost returns from bets on stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies. Because hedge funds aren't subject to Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, they offer the individual investor some investment choices he or she can't get in mutual funds, namely the option to profit from stock-market declines by selling borrowed shares short.</br></br>For investment companies, though, hedge funds present the constant threat that carefully groomed talent will be drained away. The lure: hedge funds' usual annual charge of 1% on assets under management, plus a 20% cut of gains for the top dog (whether performance tops the benchmarks or not). In recent years, a weed patch of fresh hedge funds has sprouted as a result: One estimate puts total assets in such funds at $370 billion, in 3,000 funds.</br></br>"This raises the question of who will manage the big money in the future," wrote Byron Wien, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, in a report published this week that cited those estimates.
