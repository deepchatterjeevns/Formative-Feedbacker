Clinton Urges China to Join Pollution Fight; President Unveils Several U.S. Initiatives to Help Protect Nation's Environment
From the commercial bustle of Shanghai to the renowned natural beauty of this city, President Clinton devoted two of the closing days of his China tour to a campaign aimed at persuading the Chinese that robust economic growth does not have to come at the expense of their country's fragile environment.</br></br>Clinton spent Wednesday touting China's recent moves toward market economics, including a tour of the Shanghai stock market and a luncheon with young entrepreneurs. But his generally ebullient remarks were tempered by a dire warning about the damaging effects that China's industrialization is having on air, water, and food quality.</br></br>Clinton continued to develop his environmental theme here in Guilin, where the Li River and the unusual limestone formations that jut up out of the valley floor create a striking natural tableau that has been memorialized for centuries in Chinese art.</br></br>Cooling himself in sweltering heat with a colorful Chinese fan -- he called it "an energy-efficient air conditioner" -- Clinton told Guilin residents today: "China has a unique opportunity, because you are developing rapidly but later in time than other countries, to avoid making the same mistakes we have made."</br></br>In the speech, Clinton announced a number of initiatives that will provide U.S. assistance to an incipient Chinese anti-pollution movement.
