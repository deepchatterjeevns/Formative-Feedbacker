Debate Over Jobless Benefits Resonates Near and Far
As Virginia gears up for a governor's campaign with national implications, a growing debate over federally funded unemployment insurance has become an early popularity test of President Obama's stimulus package and his vision of government's role in an economic downturn.</br></br>Democrats have been pounding the Republican-led House of Delegates and Robert F. McDonnell, the GOP's candidate for governor, since the House voted last month to reject $125 million in federal stimulus funds to bulk up unemployment benefits. Democratic candidates are increasingly convinced that voters will see the rejection of the federal dollars as a betrayal of struggling workers.</br></br>But Republicans have not backed down. Accepting the money would have meant agreeing to adjust Virginia's insurance program and accepting strings imposed by Congress that GOP leaders have said are symptomatic of an expansion of the federal government under Democratic control.</br></br>The fight represents a deep philosophical divide between the parties that voters are expected to weigh when they go to the polls in November.</br></br>"This is one that really matters. It's a very direct issue about what is the role of government and how should we respond to people in a very tough time," said Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D), who accused lawmakers of turning their backs on the unemployed April 8 when the House voted 53 to 46, largely along party lines, to reject the funds.
