Bush's Support Broad but Not Deep;Poll Finds Concern About Slowness on Major Domestic Problems
President Bush continues to enjoy widespread overall public support, but a new Washington Post-ABC News Poll shows that a majority of Americans worry that he is moving too slowly on a range of major domestic problems, from pollution to dealing with illegal drugs to the budget deficit.</br></br>Bush's broad support-76 percent of those surveyed approved of the job he is doing-is matched rarely when voters are asked if they approve of his handling of specific, domestic issues. On foreign affairs, large majorities favorably view Bush's responses to new Soviet arms initiatives and to recent developments in Eastern Europe.</br></br>Nine months into his presidency, support for Bush remains broad but not deep, according to the poll. Only 29 percent of the respondents said they strongly approve of the Bush presidency.</br></br>Together, the numbers appear to describe a president who is more generally liked than his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, but who does not enjoy the intensity of support that Reagan did. Reagan, nine months into his first term, had an overall approval rating of 64 percent, with more than half of that support coming from those who strongly approved.</br></br>Republican pollsters say the big surprise in recent polling numbers has been Bush's consistently high approval rating among blacks, up to 60 percent in the most recent Post-ABC poll, similar to the result among blacks in the latest survey by the Wirthlin Group, a Republican polling firm, and three times the level of black support for Reagan.
