Central Fidelity wants to switch its regulator
One of Virginia's largest banks has reacted to criticism of it by the Federal Reserve--for allegedly discriminating against some customers--by deciding to apply for a new charter that would remove it from the Fed's oversight.</br></br>Carroll L. Saine, chairman of the board of Richmond-based Central Fidelity Banks Inc., delivered a banker's version of a broadside against the Fed at yesterday's annual shareholders meeting.</br></br>Saine said the bank would seek to replace its current state charter with a national one, under which it would be regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency rather than by the Fed.</br></br>Central Fidelity's unusual action comes in response to a report issued confidentially to the bank last month in which the Fed gave the bank a less-than-satisfactory rating on meeting community credit needs. The report, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, contends that the bank discriminated in lending on the basis of age and marital status, and defined certain neighborhoods served by its offices in a way that excluded neighboring low-and moderate-income areas.</br></br>"In my opinion, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency--while harsh in their examinations--is logical, objective, basically nonpolitical and more fairly represents the high standards of our bank, its stockholders, customers and employees," Saine told the annual meeting in Richmond.
