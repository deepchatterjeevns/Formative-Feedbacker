A Working Thesis: Growth of Labor Force Slows, Raising Hopes Of Lower Jobless Rates --- Trend, if It Holds, May Lead To Greater Productivity; How Women Affect Data --- Baby Boomers Come of Age
The rapid decline in the unemployment rate to 8.4% in November from a postwar high of 10.8% just 11 months earlier has surprised economists and pleased the Reagan administration. But the best news may lie in the future.</br></br>Analysts see in the recent jobless data signs of a significant change in the growth of the work force. "We're switching from a decade in which the labor force grew faster than the population to one in which it will grow slower," William Dunkelberg, an economics professor at Purdue University, says.</br></br>If this trend holds, the current decade could turn out to be the mirror image of the economically troubled 1970s. The work force exploded in the last decade as women and members of the "baby boom" generation sought jobs. "We had some digestive problems," says Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution, noting that in the 1970s the jobless rate rose, the rate of growth of worker productivity slowed and inflation soared. But in this decade, "we may find ourselves able to do more on the employment front without causing an increase in inflation," Mr. Bosworth says.</br></br>Sidney Jones, the undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, adds, "After getting ourselves convinced that 6 1/2% is a natural rate of unemployment, it may be that we can do better than that."</br></br>An easing of labor-force growth could have other implications as well. For instance, older workers, who in recent years were pushed out of the labor market by early-retirement plans to make room for younger workers, may find themselves in more demand again. Mr. Dunkelberg believes that the retirement age is likely to rise during the current decade as employers, faced with shortages of new workers, rely on older workers to stay on the job longer.
