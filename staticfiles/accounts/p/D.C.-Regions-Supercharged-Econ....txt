D.C. Region's Supercharged Economy Shifts Into Low Gear
Because of an error, an article yesterday on the Washington area economy misstated a drop in home prices in Fairfax and Montgomery counties. The article should havbe said that new-home sales have fallen 50 percent in the counties. (Published 12/19/89)</br></br>Pauline De Silva and Ralph Papsidero have been trying to sell their house in Great Falls for a year. They started by asking $485,000, then cut the price to $444,000. But they still haven't received an acceptable offer.</br></br>Like many Washington area homeowners, De Silva and Papsidero are learning that the bloom is off the local real estate market, evidence of a slowdown in the overall Washington economy that marks a sharp turn from nearly a decade of spectacular growth in the 1980s.</br></br>"I like to think otherwise, but I do believe we're seeing a slowdown," said William Harris, president of Crestar Bank of Washington and chairman of the Washington Baltimore Regional Association, a business research group. "I don't think we're in a major slowdown or in a major recession, and hopefully we're going to come out of this thing quickly. But I think we're kidding ourself if we don't think there's a slowdown after the past seven or eight years of spectacular growth."</br></br>The economic deceleration is likely to last a couple of years, economists and analysts said. And while Washington is not heading for an economic bust similar to the ones suffered by Houston and Denver, the shift to a more moderate rate of expansion may seem particularly harsh to those who have become accustomed to the housing market's double-digit growth during the 1980s. It also would be a jolt to the numerous defense contracting companies that flourished during the defense buildup in the 1980s and now are dealing with the specter of cuts in military spending. {Related story, Washington Business.} "It's a perception sort of thing," said David Berson, chief economist at Federal National Mortgage Association, the Washington-based mortgage finance institution. If {increases in home prices} have been running at 15 or 20 percent, and now they're only running 5 or 10 percent, it sure feels like the market is doing badly."
