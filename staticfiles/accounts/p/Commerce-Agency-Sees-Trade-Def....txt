Commerce Agency Sees Trade Deficit Up to $160 Billion
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit could swell to as much as $160 billion this year, resulting in additional layoffs in manufacturing industries, the Commerce Department predicted.</br></br>In its midyear trade outlook, the department noted that a robust U.S. economy compensated for similar job losses in 1982 and 1983 by creating 7.3 million new jobs. But with slower growth this year, the department forecast, the continuing stream of imports could hurt employment and lead to larger foreign shares of the markets for cars, telecommunication equipment and other products.</br></br>The department calculated the 1985 deficit to be in the range of $140 billion to $160 billion. The larger end was bigger than Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige's earlier forecast that the deficit will hit $150 billion this year.</br></br>The department cautioned that its latest outlook doesn't signal any change in the administration's policy of resisting legislation designed to curb imports or retaliate harshly against trading partners. Its report noted that foreign restrictions against U.S. exports are only one of several causes of the deficit.</br></br>The document also cited the strong dollar, import cutbacks by highly indebted countries, a narrowing U.S. technological edge and the continuing strength of the U.S. economy compared with that of other industrialized nations.
