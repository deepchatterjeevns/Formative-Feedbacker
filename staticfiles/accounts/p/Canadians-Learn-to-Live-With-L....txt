As for that long-regretted tattoo, the country's system of national health care would pay to have it scrubbed away.</br></br>It became an article of national faith, even identity, that there would be a government program to help any Canadian in need, and even some who weren't.</br></br>A product of the country's booming economy and liberal politics during the 1960s, "the feeling was that we were getting rich . . . and that we should share," said William Watson, an associate professor of economics at McGill University in Montreal.
