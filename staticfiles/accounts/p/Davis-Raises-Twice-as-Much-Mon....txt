Davis Raises Twice as Much Money as Moore in Fairfax Race
Republican Fairfax Supervisor Thomas M. Davis III has raised more than twice as much money as Democratic County Board Chairman Audrey Moore, but has little left in the bank as their campaign for Northern Virginia's most visible local office swings into its final month.</br></br>According to campaign finance reports filed yesterday, Davis collected $65,768 during September, bringing his total to $350,449, while Moore pulled in $39,388 during the same period, for a total of $156,650.</br></br>By spending less on consultants, pollsters and other campaign tools, Moore has squirreled away $47,355, while Davis has just $8,317 on hand.</br></br>The high-profile chairman's race has dwarfed every other contest in Northern Virginia in terms of big-bucks fund-raising. But it remains uncertain whether the two campaigns will be able to match the record-setting $1 million spending of the watershed 1987 election that swept Moore into office.</br></br>Strategists in both camps insisted they will raise what they need to win, but with just five weeks until the Nov. 5 election, ensuring money for television advertising has become a critical focus for Moore and Davis. "It's out there," said Davis campaign manager John Hishta. "It's difficult to get, but we're pursuing it as hard as we can."
