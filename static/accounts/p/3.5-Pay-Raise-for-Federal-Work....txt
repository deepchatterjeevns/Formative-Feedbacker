3.5% Pay Raise for Federal Workers Gains Momentum With Senate Panel's Approval
Last week, a Senate Appropriations subcommittee approved the raise as part of a $90.6 billion spending bill for the Transportation and Treasury departments and several small agencies. The pay raise was approved by the House Appropriations Committee in July.</br></br>The decision by the Senate subcommittee should make it relatively easy for the House and Senate to include the raise in legislation that can be sent to the president. But House and Senate aides expect that it might be weeks before Congress wraps up spending bills for fiscal 2005, raising the prospect that House-Senate agreement on the pay raise might not be reached until after Election Day.</br></br>President Bush proposed a 1.5 percent pay raise for the civil service and a 3.5 percent raise for the military in his fiscal 2005 budget. But several members of the Washington area delegation organized support for a "pay parity" approach to provide the government's civilian employees with a raise equal to that of the military.</br></br>Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who often plays a key role in the annual pay-setting process, has repeatedly noted that Congress has provided equal pay adjustments to civil service and military employees in 17 of the past 20 years.</br></br>During this year's debate, Hoyer and other Washington area lawmakers stressed that civil service employees have taken on expanded responsibilities for homeland security and the war against terrorism.
