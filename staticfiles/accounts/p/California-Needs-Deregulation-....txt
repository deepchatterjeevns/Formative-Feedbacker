California Needs Deregulation Done Right
The electricity market in California has swung over its history from monopolization by industrialists in its early days to comprehensive regulation, then to partial deregulation in the 1990s, and now back toward substantial regulation and government intervention. In the past, each swing of the pendulum came from public frustration with the way this market operated, and each produced a result that the public again found unsatisfactory.</br></br>But the memory of politicians and the public is short. The state is poised to repeat the mistakes of the last cycle of regulation. Measures passed by the California Legislature this month are an ill-conceived intervention that will lock the state into high energy costs and put it at a competitive disadvantage for years to come.</br></br>Unless there is further action, the state will maintain subsidized retail prices that discourage conservation, while capping in-state wholesale prices in a manner that discourages construction of new in-state generation capacity and leaves Californians at the mercy of out-of-state generators. Government subsidization of electricity consumption will drain tax revenues that might be better used for education and other needs, encumber California's children with debt to pay the state's energy bills, and threaten the state's future ability to sell bonds for public projects. The immediate political cost of consumer outrage from higher electricity rates may be postponed, but the real economic cost promises to be massive.</br></br>The sad thing is that this is all unnecessary.</br></br>The source of the crisis was rigid regulation of retail prices in the face of rapid increases in wholesale prices driven by increased fuel prices and increased demand in the national electricity market. The only effective solution to the crisis is to make retail price regulation more flexible, so that consumers see the real economic cost of electricity and respond to high prices through conservation efforts that reduce demand and push prices down. On the supply side, the state should encourage construction of new in-state generation capacity through the right market signals, giving producers the opportunity to site plants and sell power under conditions comparable to other states.
