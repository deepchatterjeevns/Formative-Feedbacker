AIG Case May Turn on Nonstar Witnesses; Testimony in Greenberg Lawsuit Likely Wraps Up Monday
WASHINGTON--The headlines in the long-running trial over the bailout of American International Group Inc. have been dominated by three heavy hitters who testified--and one who didn't.</br></br>But as testimony likely wraps up Monday after eight weeks, legal observers said two low-profile witnesses from early in the proceedings addressed what may be the key question: whether the government correctly interpreted a 1930s-era section of the Federal Reserve Act to allow it to acquire a sizable equity stake in AIG to help compensate taxpayers.</br></br>That issue stands out as one that former longtime AIG Chief Executive Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg has the best chance of winning, said attorneys and legal scholars.</br></br>The lawsuit is at its strongest as "a test of the scope of a government agency's authority: Did it do things it was authorized to do by law, or did it exceed those boundaries?" said Anthony Sabino, a professor of law at St. John's University. "The government is vulnerable on that argument."</br></br>The nearly two months of testimony in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims delivered few bombshells.
