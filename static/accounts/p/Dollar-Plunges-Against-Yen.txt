Baker III, who described the dollar's 1 1/2-year-old decline as orderly and helpful in eventually reducing the staggering American trade deficit. Traders saw the statement as an indication that the United States is not seriously interested in supporting the dollar.</br></br>Massive sell orders for dollars swamped the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market as trading began, pushing the dollar down 2.90 yen to 142.50, its lowest close against the Japanese currency since exchange rates were set in the late 1940s.
