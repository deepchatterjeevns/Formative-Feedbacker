Known for his caution, he now appears to have made the decision to enter overtly into bilateral agreements with Israel that could culminate in a full peace treaty.</br></br>Clinton told reporters after meeting the king yesterday that he was "very encouraged by where we are now in the whole process."</br></br>In their meeting, however, the king said he needed more than oral support and "made a big deal about his debt problem," an administration official said. Debt service consumes about 30 percent of Jordan's budget.
