That isn't a welcoming environment for initial public offerings, which are considered a higher-risk security class, say investment bankers and analysts.</br></br>"These deals require a lot of stability," said Ben Holmes, president of IPO research firm Morningnotes.com.</br></br>Apollo Global Management, which had been expected to set its IPO terms such as a price range on Tuesday, instead decided to wait to see if broader markets settle down, according to people close to the deal. IPO terms are usually set a few weeks ahead of a deal's launch, so Apollo was likely aiming to go public in early April.
