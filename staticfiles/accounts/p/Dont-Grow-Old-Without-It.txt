Don't Grow Old Without It
Long-term-care insurance: It can make the difference between living out your life the way you want and becoming a burden to your family or a ward of the state.</br></br>But it is becoming significantly more expensive, more complicated and harder to get with each passing year.</br></br>Average premiums on new policies--which help pay for nursing-home, assisted-living and home care--have risen some 6% to 17% in the past year alone, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance, a trade group. Some insurers have even doubled their premiums on existing policies. The increases come as the industry grapples with low interest rates and policyholders who are living a lot longer than the actuaries said they would.</br></br>At the same time, big companies like Prudential Financial and MetLife have stopped selling new policies in the individual market, continuing a trend that began several years ago. Ten of the top 20 writers of individual coverage five years ago have announced their exit, according to Limra International, an industry-funded research firm.</br></br>Ken Kacenga, a 65-year-old doctor in Sierra Vista, Ariz., who plans to retire later this year, got hit with a 23% premium increase recently on the long-term-care insurance he and his wife bought several years ago. The couple struggled with whether to drop the coverage, he says, before finally deciding to keep it for another year while shopping around for other options.
