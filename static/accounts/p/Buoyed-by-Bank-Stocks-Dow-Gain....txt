Buoyed by Bank Stocks, Dow Gains 16
Blue-chip stocks extended their winning streak to a fourth session today, buoyed by gains in banking shares and record earnings by Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's largest brokerage house.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average ended 15.94 points higher at 3444.03. It has gained more than 91 points since the rally started last Wednesday.</br></br>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 7 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 285.97 million shares, up from 259.61 million Monday.</br></br>Meanwhile, the Dow transportation average again moved into record territory, rising 11.68 points to 1660.52, a new high for the second straight day.</br></br>But the market's advance was uneven, hampered by the lack of a convincing follow-through in bond prices. The price of the Treasury's key 30-year bond rose, but intermediate notes ended slightly lower amid lackluster demand for the Treasury's newly auctioned seven-year security.
