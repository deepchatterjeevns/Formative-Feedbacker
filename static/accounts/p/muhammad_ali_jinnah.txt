Quaid-E-Azam Muhammad Ali Jannah was architect of Pakistan. He was born on 25th December, 1876. He was born in a noble family of Karachi. He received his early education in Karachi Mission School. Then he was admitted in Sindh Madrsa-tul-Islam from where he passed his matriculation in 1895. Afterward he went to England and took his Barrister's degree from Linchon's Inn.
After completing his education, he came back to India and started law-practice in Bombay. He started his political career as a member of Bombay Legislature. Then he joined Indian Nation Congress. He was a great champion of freedom for the people of India. When he realized that the congress was a neo-Hindu body and stood for Ram Raj, he resigned and joined the All India Muslim League in 1922. He had been greatest spokesman of the Indian Muslims for a separate state for them.
By 1930 he became an undisputed leader of the Muslims. Soon he began to reorganize the Indian Muslim league all over India. People gave him the title of Quaid-e-Azam for his selfless services for the Muslim cause, freedom and creation of Pakistan.
Mr.Jinnah's integrity of character was beyond reproach. Gandhi called him 'an impossible man', for he would never compromise on principles. He stood like a rock against his opponents. He united the defeated groups of Muslims into a force to reckon with. From 1940 (The Year Of Pakistan Resolution) till his death on 11th September, 1948, Quaid-e-Azam worked day and night for strengthening the Muslim League. It was due to his untiring efforts and wise leadership that Pakistan came into being. Had there been no highly intelligent, highly disciplined, hard working, supremely, self-confident, driven by the dream and drove others. He was the first Governor General of Pakistan on 14th August 1947 but died after about the thirteen months and was buried in Karachi.
