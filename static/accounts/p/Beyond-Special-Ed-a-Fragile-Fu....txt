Beyond Special Ed, a Fragile Future; Va. Budget Gaps Diminish Transition Options
Ted Nigh wants his friends to know that life in the nursing home is all right and that they shouldn't hesitate to visit him. He is getting good care and gets along well with the staff.</br></br>Nigh is 20 years old, a 2002 graduate of Falls Church High School. He is also a quadriplegic with cerebral palsy. With no programs available to help Nigh after graduation, his father, a single parent, felt he had little choice but to put his son in a nursing home that accepts Medicaid patients. Sam Nigh, 54, who was recently laid off from his job at an insurance company, said he hopes that some alternative will come through next year.</br></br>"They're doing a good job taking care of me," Ted Nigh said of the 180-bed nursing home in Manassas where he has lived since May. But his stay "is becoming too long," he added. "You just get aggravated. . . . I don't want nursing home life to become a regular habit."</br></br>Like all states, Virginia is required by federal law to provide special education to disabled students such as Nigh. But increasingly, advocates say, the millions of dollars spent on this education are going to waste as budget cuts whittle down the programs that allow special education graduates to transition to jobs and more independent lives. This creates added burdens for parents, who sometimes must sacrifice their own jobs to stay home and care for their disabled children.</br></br>"Recent budget crunches and tax cuts have further stressed a system that is already very inadequate," said Kathy May, lead advocate for The Arc of Northern Virginia, a local affiliate of the national advocacy group The Arc, which promotes the rights of people with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities.
