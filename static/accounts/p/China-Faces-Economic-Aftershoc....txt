China Faces Economic Aftershocks; Fearful After the Quake, People Shun Jobs, Homes
Number of workers injured: zero. Number dead: zero. The factory's steel-reinforced walls shook but held during last week's massive earthquake. After it was over, the only evidence that something nightmarish had taken place in other parts of the city was the presence of minor fractures in pipes that were easily fixed.</br></br>Yet the fertilizer factory hasn't been operational since the quake struck last Monday. It isn't a problem with supplies or machinery. It's the employees.</br></br>"People have a sense of panic and dare not go into the factory to work," said Zhang, a salesman at Shifang Anda Chemical Co., which exports most of its products to the United States and Europe.</br></br>As the initial chaos of the disaster zones is being replaced by an eerily orderly rescue and cleanup effort by the military, China's leaders are turning their attention to the survivors and the economic consequences of fear.</br></br>Many thousands in and around the quake's epicenter in Sichuan province are living in tent cities or on their lawns -- even though their houses are perfectly fine.
