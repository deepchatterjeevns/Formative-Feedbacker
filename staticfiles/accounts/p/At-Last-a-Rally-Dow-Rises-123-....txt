At Last, a Rally: Dow Rises 123 Points

It was also the Dow's biggest point gain since Sept. 3.</br></br>Broader indicators were higher as well. The Standard & Poor's 500- stock index rose 14.34, to 1282.71, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 15.89, to 2746.16.</br></br>Stocks rose after the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. economy, weighed down by record trade deficits, saw its growth slow to an annual rate of 1.6 percent during the second quarter, the lowest rate of expansion in four years.</br></br>The report on the nation's gross domestic product provided some relief for investors who have driven stocks lower over the past week as they pessimistically awaited the Fed's Oct. 5 meeting on interest rates.
