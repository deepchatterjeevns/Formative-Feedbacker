3 Polls Show Executives Expect Growth to Slow
Three surveys by business groups released yesterday reported that executives expect the pace of U.S. economic growth to moderate in coming months, accompanied by a mild increase in inflation.</br></br>But a series of economic indicators reported by the government yesterday showed there are still signs of strength in the economy.</br></br>In the most striking of the reports, the Labor Department said that only 310,000 people filed initial claims for unemployment benefits last week. That was the lowest figure for any week since the spring of 1989, except for two holiday-shortened weeks just before Christmas in 1992 and 1993.</br></br>Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said new-home sales surged 9.7 percent in August, to an annual rate of 703,000 units, up from a 641,000 rate in July. Most of the gain came in the Northeast, where sales nearly doubled to a 102,000-unit rate, an increase so great that several analysts discounted it as a statistical aberration.</br></br>One of the surveys - Dun & Bradstreet Corp.'s quarterly questioning of 3,000 executives - found that most of the respondents expect smaller gains in sales and profits and less new hiring than their firms have experienced so far this year.
