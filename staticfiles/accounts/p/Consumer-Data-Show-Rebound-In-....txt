Consumer Data Show Rebound In Confidence --- October Gains, After Drop In September, Indicate Economy Is Advancing
NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence bounced back in October after dipping sharply in September.</br></br>The survey, taken in the first two weeks of last month, reinforces evidence that the economy is still advancing. But analysts are still puzzling over what caused the previous month's decline.</br></br>"The September slide now appears to represent a pause in the long-running U.S. expansion, not a signal of a downturn. Latest readings suggest sustained growth ahead," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.</br></br>The consumer confidence index gained almost all the ground lost in the September dip, rising to 117.4 from a revised 110.7 (originally reported as 109). In August, the index stood at 119.7. The Conference Board's Confidence Index, which uses 1985 as a base of 100, fell in September to its lowest level since just after the October 1987 stock market crash.</br></br>Nearly 20.6% of the 5,000 households surveyed by National Family Opinion Inc., Toledo, Ohio, for the Conference Board said they expect business conditions to improve over the next six months, compared with 18.3% in September. About 6.9% in the October survey said they expected business conditions to worsen, compared with 9.8% the previous month, according to the New York-based, nonprofit, industry-supported group.
