A Star To Follow
"Y ou are doing a disservice to your readers," a man I called Ursa Major, the Great Bear, told me a while back. He was referring to my perennial bullishness, my buy-and-hold obsession.</br></br>Specifically, he pointed to an article that said, "The best way to approach the market is simply to go along for the ride wherever it leads."</br></br>Ursa Major's view at the time was that the ride was headed off a cliff and that I should have been warning of the imminent catastrophe. What was happening in the stock market, he told me, was "crazy," and "it doesn't end happily."</br></br>My conversation with Ursa Major became the focus of a column, published on July 23, 1998, that presented the bearish case for stocks -- Ursa's case, not mine. It appeared a little less than two years before the tech-stock bubble popped and a widespread bear market began.</br></br>At the time, I emphasized that I didn't believe that the "intelligent bear's case," however convincing, should lead readers to dump shares of good companies that they bought for the long haul. As it turned out, the case was not only intelligent but prescient -- although not quite as prescient as you might think. I am glad I published it. My only regret was that Ursa Major discouraged me from using his real name.
