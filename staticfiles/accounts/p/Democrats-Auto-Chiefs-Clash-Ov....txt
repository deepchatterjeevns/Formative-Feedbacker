Democrats, Auto Chiefs Clash Over Industry's Direction
Senate Democrats lashed out at the three leading U.S. auto executives yesterday for fighting legislation to force improvements in vehicle gas mileage, warning that lawmakers are losing patience with the industry.</br></br>Sen. Thomas R. Carper of Delaware said Congress is tiring of the industry's argument that tougher fuel-economy rules would lead to plant closings and layoffs. Carper, whose state is losing a big Chrysler sport-utility vehicle plant, noted that the Big Three Detroit automakers have downsized significantly in the past two years.</br></br>"For the better part of 20 years, you've lost market share. There have been plant closings, and you've lost money," Carper told the auto executives. "Just keep in mind: For 20 years, we've been patient."</br></br>The Democratic senators' criticism was directed at chief executives of the domestic auto industry's three top automakers -- G. Richard Wagoner Jr. of General Motors, Alan R. Mulally of Ford and Tom LaSorda of Chrysler -- during a Capitol Hill lunch organized by Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. Ronald A. Gettelfinger, president of the United Auto Workers union, also attended.</br></br>Since winning a congressional majority in November, Democrats have been pushing automakers to accept higher fuel-economy standards. Political momentum toward a change in corporate average fuel economy standards has intensified.
