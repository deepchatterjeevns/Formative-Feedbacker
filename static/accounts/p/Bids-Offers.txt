[Inside the World of Corporate Finance & Wall Street]</br></br>Plus ca Change</br></br>The odd man out at the Chicago Board of Trade this week is someone quite familiar.</br></br>In the futures exchange's board elections Wednesday, longtime member George P. Hanley lost a three-man race to fill two director seats. In the weeks leading up to the balloting, Mr. Hanley had become embroiled in controversy over unspecified trading incentives that his firm, Infinium Capital Management, receives from a CBOT competitor, the all- electronic Eurex US market.</br></br>Speaking after losing the board race, Mr. Hanley said he believed most voters recognized exchange incentives and trading in multiple venues as standard practices in the futures industry. Still, his chances were hurt by many members' generalized fear of the rapid evolution of futures markets, especially electronic trading platforms that rival CBOT's trading floor, he added.
