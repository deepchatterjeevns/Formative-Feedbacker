Congress Should Put Trade On the Fast Track
The House of Representatives will soon vote on the question of granting the president Trade Promotion Authority, also known as fast-track approval. Some in Congress have argued that now is not the time to take up legislation that has encountered such fierce protectionist opposition in recent years. But in the wake of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and the current economic slowdown, it is all the more important that Congress move quickly to approve this vital measure.</br></br>This bipartisan action would inspire confidence in global capital markets. It would allow America to be seen as continuing to lead the open trade and globalization that has been so vital to the prosperity of both developed and developing countries. And it would send a powerful message that the president and Congress speak with one voice, and are committed to advancing freer trade as part of the war on terror. Indeed, approval of TPA would signal that the U.S. is not only seeking a military coalition, but an economic one.</br></br>The benefits of trade hardly need illuminating. America's exports accounted for approximately one-third of our extraordinary economic growth over the past decade, and exports now support over 12 million American jobs (nearly three million more than a decade ago). Jobs supported by exports typically pay 13% to 18% more than comparable employment.</br></br>Trade brings real economic benefits to the U.S. The North American Free Trade Agreement, and the completion of the previous round of trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), now generate annual income gains of $1,300 to $2,000 for the average American family of four. Trade is also fundamental to economic growth in the developing world. A recent World Bank study shows that nations open to trade grow 3.5 times faster than nations closed to trade. The recent experience of countries such as South Korea, China and Chile underscore that trade is a pathway to prosperity.</br></br>Trade is a two-way street, and imports also benefit the U.S. They provide consumers with more choices and lower prices on a wide variety of goods. Imports also force our industries to constantly improve and innovate in order to remain competitive with foreign exporters.
