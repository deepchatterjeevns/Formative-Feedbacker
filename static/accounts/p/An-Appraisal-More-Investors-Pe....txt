An Appraisal: More Investors Pessimistic on Stocks But Some Positive Signs Still Cited
Despite growing ranks of those who doubt that the bull market will enjoy a second phase, some investment officers still are counting on an upturn, at least for some sectors of the market.</br></br>For most investors, "the pendulum has swung to pessimism" because they think the economic recovery is more robust than had been expected, says Donald E. Carver, vice president of First Pennsylvania Corp., Philadelphia. They see exceptionally strong public and private credit demand and they fear the current economic strength will prompt the Federal Reserve "to adopt a more restrictive credit policy that could abort the economic recovery," he asserts.</br></br>Other negative factors, he adds, include reduced contributions to corporate pension funds and fewer stock purchases by foreigners.</br></br>However, Mr. Carver believes these negatives are outweighed by positive developments. "Although inflation is rising, it's still moderate, and commodity prices are weak," he contends. "Federal expenditures are running well below budgeted levels and the deficit for the current fiscal year won't be as bad as had been feared." He notes that with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off nearly 15% from its record high last November, it is now at book value.</br></br>In addition, Mr. Carver says that "less stock is available because over $40 billion in takeovers and stock repurchase programs has shrunk the supply."
