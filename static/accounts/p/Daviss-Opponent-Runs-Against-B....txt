Davis's Opponent Runs Against Bush
Democratic congressional candidate Shawn O'Donnell of Fredericksburg is borrowing a page from the party's national playbook in his quest to unseat Rep. Jo Ann Davis: Link the Republican incumbent to President Bush as much as possible.</br></br>"I believe she's been a rubber stamp of George Bush," O'Donnell, 51, said. "Literally every failure this administration has had, she's got a degree of guilt that should be associated with those politics."</br></br>Davis, 56, was first elected in 2000 to represent Virginia's 1st Congressional District and has raised five times as much money as O'Donnell. She dismissed the Democrat's criticism.</br></br>"I just run on my own record," Davis said. "I don't look at what my opponent's doing, and I don't say anything about what my opponent's doing."</br></br>The candidates offer stark differences to voters in a district that includes parts of Prince William, Spotsylvania, Stafford and Fauquier counties.
