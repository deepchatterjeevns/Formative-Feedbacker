Calvert GOP's Gaffe Directed Donations to County Treasurer
The Republican Party certainly controls the seat of Calvert County government, with four of the five county commissioners being members of the GOP.</br></br>But -- contrary to a notice in a newsletter distributed by Calvert Republicans -- the party hasn't been so brazen as to set up a fundraising office in the county treasurer's office.</br></br>Barbara Burton, chairman of the Calvert County Republic Central Committee, said the newsletter had mistakenly suggested that contributions to the Young Republican Fundraiser could be dropped at the county office.</br></br>Burton said the notice "was just an honest mistake" made by someone filling in for the person who regularly compiles the newsletter. A computer glitch, Burton explained, ended up merging an item about Calvert Treasurer Novalea Tracy-Soper with a request for funds to send members to the Young Republican National Convention held in Boston this month.</br></br>The merged item read: "If you would like to contribute, you can see your favorite Young Republican; drop off a check to Nova Soper, treasurer's office, or by mail PO Box 1621, Prince Frederick, MD, 20678."
