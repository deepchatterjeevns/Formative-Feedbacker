Consumer Spending, Income Eased in February
WASHINGTON -- Americans' income and spending moderated in February but may still be growing enough to keep the economy from tipping into a recession.</br></br>Personal income edged up 0.4% in February, the Commerce Department reported Friday, while personal-consumption expenditures rose 0.3%. January income was revised to a gain of 0.5%, down from the 0.6% pace previously estimated. Consumer spending in January was revised to a gain of 1%, up from the 0.7% gain first reported.</br></br>In another indication that consumers may be counted on to keep the economy growing, even while manufacturing flails, a widely watched barometer of consumer confidence rose in March after three months of declines.</br></br>The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment index, which measures current and future economic expectations, rose to 91.5 last month from 90.6 in February, according to people familiar with the report. Analysts had expected a lower reading because of the recent stock-market turmoil.</br></br>But a separate report Friday gave further evidence of the sharp slowdown among U.S. businesses. The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago reported that its index of business activity in the Midwest fell to 35.0 in March, its lowest level in 19 years. Any number below 50 signals that business in the manufacturing sector is contracting. Analysts had expected a reading of 43.5, slightly higher than the 43.2 level reported for February. The Chicago survey is widely watched for indications of the index of the National Association of Purchasing Management, whose March report will be released today.
