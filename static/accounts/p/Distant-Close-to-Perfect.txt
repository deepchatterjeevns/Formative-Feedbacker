'Distant' Close to Perfect
"DISTANT," a moving character piece from Nuri Bilge Ceylan, clearly derives some of its sensibilities from the hallowed cinematic churches of Andrei Tarkovsky and Yasujiro Ozu (and there's a little Chekhov, too, in his approach). Following the protracted tension between two lonely Turkish men, it at first seems to be about nothing, a minute-to-minute observation of two uneventful, frustrating lives.</br></br>Ultimately, it becomes a movie about the feeling of being alive, the sensation of existence. It's a movie, in a way, about everything.</br></br>One of the men is Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir), a bearded, quiet photographer in Istanbul who has divorced his wife. He has a job, taking shots of objects for a commercial business. But he's essentially alone and lonely. There is a woman with whom he spends time on occasion; and he reaches for the odd porn video, too. Surrounded by books and photographs, he keeps a clean house. He's set in his ways and heading nowhere.</br></br>When his younger cousin Yusuf (Mehmet Emin Toprak) comes to visit, Mahmut's comfortably self-contained routine is broken. The visitor, who hails from the same village as Mahmut, has lost his factory job. He hangs around the port, looking for any kind of work. His hope is to find a job on a luxury cruiser that travels around the world. He has no luck. There's a nationwide recession.</br></br>Yusuf, not a particularly attractive man with an ungainly bump on the side of his face, is a slob who smokes all over the house, leaves food lying around and, when he's not looking for a job, starts following a woman around town who strikes his fancy.
