Bond Prices Fall Slightly, Rates Finish Little Changed After Wednesday's Rally
NEW YORK -- The credit markets took a breather yesterday after a strong rally late Wednesday.</br></br>Most interest rates wound up little changed in quiet activity. Bond prices fell slightly as the Treasury sold $7 billion of new 10-year notes in another in a string of auctions scheduled until Thanksgiving.</br></br>The average annual yield on the Treasury notes was 9.54%. That was down from 10.6% at the previous auction of similar notes held Aug. 7 and was the lowest since May 1979.</br></br>Traders paid little attention to a Federal Reserve System report late yesterday that showed the basic money supply rose $1.5 billion in the week ended Nov. 11. The increase in the money measure, known as M1, was roughly in line with forecasts of most analysts in several surveys earlier this week.</br></br>Wednesday's bond market rally was sparked by speculation that Congress finally will approve legislation designed to force large budget cuts soon and balance the budget by 1991. The credit markets' outlook depends heavily on what happens to that proposed legislation, according to Elliott Platt, senior vice president and economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.
