Bentsen Won't Rule Out Delay In Tax Increase --- Postponing Levy on Income May Not Be Necessary, Treasury Secretary Says
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the Clinton administration is willing to consider delaying its proposed increases in personal income taxes to shield the economy from harm this year, but said he doubts that will be necessary.</br></br>President Clinton's economic plan calls for making the increases in income-tax rates for upper-income Americans retroactive to Jan. 1, 1993. Mr. Bentsen indicated some congressional Democrats fear such a move could interfere with Mr. Clinton's goal of creating 500,000 jobs this year.</br></br>Mr. Bentsen said the discussions with lawmakers, however, don't anticipate any delay in the increase in the corporate income tax, which would also be retroactive to Jan. 1. Jobs Are Paramount "What we want to be sure of is that we achieve the 500,000 jobs," Mr. Bentsen said in an interview yesterday. Although expressing a willingness to consider the congressional concerns, Mr. Bentsen said he believes the recent decline in long-term interest rates would more than compensate for any slowing of the economy that might be caused by the higher tax rates.</br></br>Lower interest rates encourage businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, and Mr. Bentsen said the decline in interest rates in response to the Clinton plan has been "more than I anticipated." On Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 7%, its lowest mark since the government began issuing the bonds regularly in 1977.</br></br>Delaying the effective dates of the new 36% and 39.6% marginal income tax rates for a year would reduce by about $10 billion the revenue Mr. Clinton's plan would produce. But Mr. Bentsen said the administration would move up the effective dates of other tax increases to compensate so that it could still reach its 1997 deficit-reduction goal. The new energy tax, for instance, could be phased in more rapidly; currently, it is to be phased in over three years beginning July 1, 1994.
