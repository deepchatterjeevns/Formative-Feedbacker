On the other hand, the possibility of further stock market advances and a downturn in interest rates later this year makes them reluctant to head for the exit.</br></br>"Convertible bonds offer a defensive way to take your foot off the equity throttle while keeping a finger in equity-like performance," says Michael Rodier, associate portfolio manager at Wellington Management Co.</br></br>That's fine, in theory.

"You've got to be much more careful now."
