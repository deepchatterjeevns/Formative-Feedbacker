An Honest Budget and Honest Cuts for a Change
The task of the budget summit has always been difficult. It has become even more difficult as the economy has slowed and events in the Middle East have accelerated. Increases in the gasoline tax, deeper defense cuts and other options that appeared attractive to some a few weeks ago now must be viewed in a different context. The choices are tougher.

It has never worked as it was intended to, for four principal reasons:
