3DO Faces Struggle to Keep Video-Game Player Alive --- U.S. Sales Are Disappointing and Key Partner, Some Suppliers Pull Back
Trip Hawkins, the charismatic chairman of 3DO Co., may be forced to dig deep into his own pockets to help keep his video-game player afloat for the next year, as a key partner and several game suppliers appear to be backing away.</br></br>3DO is trying to break into the major leagues as the video-game industry, ruled by Sega Enterprises Ltd. and Nintendo Co., shifts to a more powerful breed of game machines. Some big names are backing 3DO's ambition, including Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Time Warner Inc. and AT&T Corp. The company says it has recruited 550 outside game developers and pressed over one million copies of 50 titles on compact disks that hold computer data. It also asserts it got off to a "strong start" in Japan, selling 80,000 machines in the first two months.</br></br>But despite a blizzard of publicity generated in part by Mr. Hawkins's marketing skills, the company has been hampered by surprisingly slow initial sales in the U.S. where demanding kid consumers say the games don't offer enough pizazz for the $500 price. Only 40,000 units of its game player, sold under Matsushita's Panasonic label, have been sold since October despite a price cut from an original $700. "Everyone has been shocked at the lower sales," says a person close to the company. Now, after posting a $51.4 million loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 3DO has about two quarters of cash left amid mounting expenses, such as a national advertising campaign and a shift to in-house game development.</br></br>Mr. Hawkins, who is also chairman of video-game publisher Electronic Arts Inc., has sold nearly $15 million in Electronic Arts stock since November. A person familiar with his plans says he intends to put $10 million into 3DO and raise $10 million from GoldStar Co., a Korean conglomerate, and an additional $10 million from current partners in a private placement of stock by the end of June. The company had attempted to raise money through a secondary offering last December, but its sagging stock price thwarted the plan. Having peaked at $47 in October, the stock closed unchanged at $15.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday.</br></br>"I enjoy putting my money where my mouth is," Mr. Hawkins says, but declines to discuss specific plans for his money or identify any next-round investors. As for 3DO's cash squeeze, he says, "It's a moot point . . . There is plenty of money that wants to be invested in the company."
