1 he U.S. Postal Service yesterday reported that for the fourth straight four-week period this fiscal year, its finances are in the black.</br></br>Postmaster General William F*. Bol-ger, speaking before the monthly meeting of the postal service board of governors, said that for the last four-week period he had expected a $3.2 million loss instead of the $1.7 million profit.
