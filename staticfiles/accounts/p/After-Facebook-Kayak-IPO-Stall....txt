After Facebook, Kayak IPO Stalls
Kayak Software Corp. slowed its march to the stock market in one of the clearest examples yet of the fallout from Facebook Inc.'s tumultuous initial public offering.</br></br>Kayak, which runs a travel-listings website, didn't launch its "roadshow" to pitch the stock to large investors, an event that had been expected to begin around Memorial Day, people familiar with the matter said. Morgan Stanley, the lead bank on the Facebook deal, also is leading the Kayak deal. With Facebook proving a disappointment for many investors, timing for the Kayak deal is uncertain now, the people said, adding that the company is assessing investors' current appetite for Internet stock deals.</br></br>"We're waiting for market conditions to meet our requirements" for an IPO, said Kayak spokeswoman Jessica Casano-Antonellis on Wednesday. She said the IPO hasn't been delayed because the company never set a time frame for its offering.</br></br>As the first significant Internet IPO expected after Facebook's debut nearly two weeks ago, Kayak was shaping up as a big test both of the IPO market and of Morgan Stanley, which has endured criticism that it overestimated demand for Facebook shares.</br></br>On Wednesday, the shares fell another 2.25% to $28.19, leaving them down more than 25% from their IPO price of $38.
