Deals & Deal Makers: U.S.I. Receives Tepid Greetings From Investors
NEW YORK -- Finishing a rough road to the public markets, U.S.I. Holdings Corp. traded flat in its IPO yesterday.</br></br>U.S.I., an insurance broker based in San Francisco, was forced to cut the initial public offering's price and switch its home stock market last week -- from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Stock Market -- but eventually did sell nine million shares at $10 apiece, the low end of estimates of $10 to $11 a share. As of 4 p.m. in Nasdaq trading, USI shares stood at $10 each.</br></br>The company originally had hoped to sell 11.4 million shares at $13 to $15 a share, but those expectations were cut last week. The reduction also meant that U.S.I. fell below market-capitalization requirements of the NYSE; hence, it switched to Nasdaq.</br></br>U.S.I. focuses on small to midsize businesses, traditionally companies employing between 20 and 1,000 people. It has been built mainly through the acquisition of smaller, independent firms, and the offering was designed to help the company trim some of the debt accumulated through those transactions.</br></br>The company is using proceeds from the offering, which was led by Merrill Lynch & Co. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., to lower its debt to $150.7 million from $229.2 million.
