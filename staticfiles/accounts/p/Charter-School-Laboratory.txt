Charter School Laboratory
Opponents of education vouchers like to say they prefer "public school choice" known as charters. But even that claim often turns out to be an illusion under pressure from teachers unions. Consider what's happening in Connecticut, where Republican Governor M. Jodi Rell is resisting charter expansion despite their notable success in the state.</br></br>Charter schools -- which are free from many of the union work-rule constraints imposed on regular public schools -- have been allowed in Connecticut since 1997, and there are now 14 of them. A study by Western Michigan University found that the state's charter students "are gaining more on the state assessment tests than students in surrounding traditional public schools."</br></br>If charter middle schools were treated as a single school district, it would lead the state among districts with more than 25% black and Hispanic enrollment. Another WMU study conducted three years ago found similar results, and the authors note that, of the six states they're monitoring, "the results from Connecticut are the most positive and promising for charter schools that we have seen."</br></br>Alas, Connecticut is also one of only two states -- the other is New Jersey -- that artificially cap charter enrollment (at 300 students per school), and thus its schools have an average waiting list of 200 students. Reformers want to expand the number of charter schools, as well as remove the enrollment limit; make charters eligible for the state's school construction program; and raise charter spending by a modest $10 million to bring them in line with what the state spends on other public schools.</br></br>Connecticut currently spends on average about $9,100 per student in regular public schools, though that figure can run to $13,000 in urban districts such as New Haven and Hartford. Teacher salaries are among the highest in the country. By contrast, under current law the state allots charters just $7,250 per student, even though most charters operate in urban districts and, unlike regular public schools, must also cover their own facility costs.
