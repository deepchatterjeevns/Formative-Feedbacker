Dow Slips 3 as Investors Await Jobless Numbers
Stocks closed mixed today, with investors still nervous about the nation's recovery as weak economic figures continued to pile up.</br></br>"It's a yellow flag when the bond market stops going up despite the fact that we saw very weak economic numbers yesterday and to some extent today," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.77 points to close at 3516.08. Advancing issues led declining ones by about 11 to 8 on New York Stock Exchange volume of 280.9 million shares.</br></br>In the latest economic figures, May factory orders fell 1.4 percent - the third straight decline to the lowest level since November. Now investors are awaiting more data this week to gauge growth.</br></br>"The portfolio managers that I talk to are simply retreating to the sidelines," waiting for a national purchasing managers' report Thursday on manufacturing activity and the June unemployment report on Friday, Johnson said.
