Congress Wants $2 Billion for Conrail, But Several Obstacles Complicate Sale
WASHINGTON -- Congress, in approving the sale of Consolidated Rail Corp., said the government should try to get $2 billion for the freight carrier. But a number of factors may make it difficult to achieve that goal.</br></br>The complicating factors, analysts said, include a decision by lawmakers to impose tough rules for the tax treatment of Conrail's eventual buyers, uncertainty about the future of the economy and the stock market, and the lingering threat posed by continuing efforts to increase regulatory controls on railroads.</br></br>"The price the government gets through selling the shares does, of course, depend on market conditions," Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in an interview, adding that "there are reasons why you may not reach" the congressional goal of $2 billion. But she said she was pleased that the House dropped its insistence on a minimum price of $1.7 billion, which investment advisers had warned could kill the sale outright.</br></br>Congress's $2 billion goal represents a projected sale price of $1.7 billion for the government's 85% stake in the Northeast railroad, and the transfer of up to $300 million to government coffers from Conrail's ample cash reserves.</br></br>Lawmakers set the goal before they settled on more stringent tax treatment for Conrail than the administration wanted. Analysts estimate the tax decision could depress the sale price by $200 million to $500 million.
