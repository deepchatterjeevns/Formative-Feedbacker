Dow Industrials Add to Gains, Top 9300 Mark
THE DOW JONES Industrial Average rose for the sixth time in the past seven trading sessions, pushing back above 9300 and nearing a 12-month high. But trading could be affected today by the massive power outage yesterday.</br></br>The late-afternoon power outage in the Northeast disrupted afterhours trading, as rattled investors sought the relative safety of Treasury bonds. They pushed some stock futures down and bid Treasurys up.</br></br>Following the power outage, the 10-year Treasury note, which had been up 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000 invested, at 4 p.m. EDT, soared to a gain of more than 1 3/32. It then fell back somewhat amid reports that the outage appeared to be a result of natural causes.</br></br>Stocks began the day with mild declines, following disappointing quarterly results from retail chain Target. But they quickly rebounded on favorable economic news and on the announcement, late in the day, that the accused organizer of last year's deadly nightclub bombing in Bali, Indonesia, had been captured.</br></br>The Dow finished regular trading up 38.80 points, or 0.42%, at 9310.56. It recovered all of the previous day's pullback and moved almost to the 12-month high of 9323.02 that it hit in June. The blue- chip average now is up almost 12% since the year began.
