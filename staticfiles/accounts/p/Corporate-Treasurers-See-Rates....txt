Corporate Treasurers See Rates Rising But Don't Say a Downturn Will Result
Corporate treasurers expect interest rates to continue rising for the rest of the year and into 1989 without provoking a business downturn.</br></br>Despite the highest short-term rates since last October's stock-market crash, the outlook "is very optimistic," says Wayland F. Blood, vice president and treasurer at Detroit-based Ford Motor Credit Co., echoing the view of many of the nation's biggest industrial companies. Many treasurers anticipated the Federal Reserve's increase in the discount rate to 6 1/2% from 6% last week and say it prompted no change in financing plans.</br></br>The Fed's decision to tighten credit by raising its lending fee to banks, however, caused rates on Treasury bills, bank certificates of deposit and commercial paper to spurt 0.2 percentage point in four days. The yield on the government's most recently issued 30-year bond rose 0.3 percentage point last week to 9.43%, its highest level since Dec. 11, according to Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Treasury bond prices fell as much as three points, or $30 for each $1,000 face amount.</br></br>Even with expectations that short-term and long-term rates could rise at least another half a point, corporate financial officers are optimistic the expansion will continue for a seventh consecutive year.</br></br>"There's a lot of strength in the economy, based on what's going over the counters at our restaurants," says Jack Greenberg, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Oakbrook, Ill.-based McDonald's Corp. "The Fed's discount rate increase was expected and doesn't change any of our plans for expansion."
