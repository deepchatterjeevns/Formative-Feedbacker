D.C.'s Jobless Rate Hits Eight-Year Low
The unemployment rate in the District dropped to 7.2 percent in March from February's 7.4 percent, the best showing in eight years, as the economic recovery spread to nearly every section of the capital.</br></br>Although the District's jobless rate remains more than three times that of the Washington suburbs' 2.1 percent rate in March, the capital's improvement is dramatic nonetheless. In March 1998, D.C. unemployment stood at 9.3 percent. (The suburban figure is not adjusted for seasonal employment changes.)</br></br>Job gains at District offices and restaurants, consulting and law firms and retail outlets contributed to an increase of 3,800 private- sector jobs over the past year.</br></br>There were 7,200 more D.C. residents at work this past March than in the same month a year earlier. Meanwhile, the number of unemployed D.C. residents declined to 19,000 in March from 24,700 a year earlier.</br></br>The District's improvement comes in part from the updraft of a strong national economy and in part from the District's enhanced image, analysts noted.
