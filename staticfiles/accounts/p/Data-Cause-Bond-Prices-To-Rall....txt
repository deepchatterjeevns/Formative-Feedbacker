Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.37 to 442.01 and the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 1.26 to 669.51.</br></br>Bond investors were encouraged by yesterday's downbeat economic news. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index declined to 55.8% in February from 58% in January. It was the first time since September that the index, which measures activity in the manufacturing sector, hasn't increased from the previous month.</br></br>In addition, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes slid 6.4% in January from December, and the Commerce Department reported that construction spending fell 1.3% in January from December.</br></br>Analysts said bond prices continue to rally in the belief that the bond market will benefit regardless of the outcome of President Clinton's economic proposals. If Mr. Clinton succeeds in cutting the deficit, government financing demands will decline, making current long-term Treasury bonds more valuable. And if the new taxes that are part of his economic plan slow the economy, as some analysts expect, inflation will remain benign.
