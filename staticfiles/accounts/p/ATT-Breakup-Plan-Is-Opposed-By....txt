AT&T Breakup Plan Is Opposed By AFL-CIO and Employee Union
A large investor in AT&T Corp., as well as the union representing 35,000 of the company's employees, is asking other AT&T shareholders to reject the telecommunications company's proposed breakup plan when it comes for a vote in May.</br></br>In a conference call with institutional investors who hold about 20% of AT&T's stock outstanding, representatives from the AFL-CIO and the Communications Workers of America said the plan to break AT&T into four separate pieces is flawed and will hurt investors in the long run.</br></br>The AFL-CIO, through its Capital Stewardship Program, works with 1,500 union-sponsored pension funds that collectively hold 25 million AT&T shares. Other participants in the call included representatives of banks and public-employee retirement funds, among others, who together hold 680 million of about 3.75 billion AT&T shares outstanding.</br></br>Michael Garland, of the AFL-CIO's office of investment, told the investors that AT&T's decision to break the company into pieces was prompted by management's inability to execute on its original strategy of selling a bundle of telecommunications services.</br></br>Faced with a sharp decline in its big consumer long-distance business, mounting debt from a host of acquisitions, as well as a plunging share price, AT&T said in October that it would split into three stand-alone entities: wireless, broadband and business services. The company's consumer long-distance business will be paired with its Business Services unit and trade as a tracking stock.
