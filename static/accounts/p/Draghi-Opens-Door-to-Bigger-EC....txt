Mr. Draghi signaled the ECB is willing to help, if governments deliver.</br></br>"He ruled out a swift type of approach, but at least he has told the markets if these two things are being done [by governments], then he won't let market confidence deteriorate too much. I thought it was quite well done," said Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for European Policy Studies.
