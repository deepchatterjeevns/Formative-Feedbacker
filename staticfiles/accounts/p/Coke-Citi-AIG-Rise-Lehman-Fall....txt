"I mean, we're talking 1972, 1973 here," he added, referring to a prior era of "stagflation."</br></br>Shares of Coke rose 2.15, or 3.9%, to 58.01 after Deutsche Bank raised its rating on the beverage maker to "buy" from "hold," saying the depressed dollar and emerging-market growth will help its exports. The Beijing Olympics likely will help sales in China, the broker added.</br></br>The second-best percentage gainer on the Dow was Citigroup, which rose 66 cents, or 3.4%, to 20.26. American International Group added 79 cents, or 2.4%, to 34.28.
