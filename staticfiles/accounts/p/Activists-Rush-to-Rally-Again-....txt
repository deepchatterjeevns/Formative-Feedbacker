Activists Rush to Rally Again In Last-Ditch Antiwar Effort
Antiwar activists are gearing up for a march on Washington on Saturday, the latest for a global peace movement that has mobilized with increasing frequency as the nation prepares for a war with Iraq.</br></br>In Burke, psychologist Suzanne Doherty, 56, has worked to assemble a squad of grandmothers to join her on Saturday. "This is not exclusively a young person's movement," said Doherty, founder of the Northern Virginia chapter of Grandmothers for Peace.</br></br>In Philadelphia, Betsy Payet has taken an avalanche of calls from protesters looking for seats on 20 charter buses. "The people in this so-called democracy are being ignored," she said.</br></br>And in Princeton, N.J., the Rev. Robert Moore has helped fill a five-bus caravan of homemakers, students and retirees. "They realize that this is our last best chance to try to avert a war," said Moore, 52, pastor of two United Church of Christ congregations.</br></br>The demonstration is part of a loose-knit local, national and global campaign to oppose the use of military force to disarm Iraq. The march and rally are part of an effort that will stage simultaneous rallies in San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as in other nations.
