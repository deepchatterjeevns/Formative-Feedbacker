Bonds Slip in Light Session, but Analysts Expect Higher Prices in Coming Months
NEW YORK -- The bond market wound up the year on a quiet note as prices drifted lower in light trading.</br></br>Some 30-year Treasury bonds fell 1/2 point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. The U.S. government securities market closed at about 2 p.m. Wednesday and was closed yesterday for New Year's Day.</br></br>In the final three sessions of 1986, prices of some long-term Treasury bonds slumped nearly two points, or almost $20 for each $1,000 face amount. The setback came amid concern about a recent surge in oil prices and the dollar's continued slump in foreign-exchange markets. These developments, along with a sharp increase in the price of gold Wednesday, have intensified fears among some investors about the inflation outlook.</br></br>Most forecasters in recent surveys still expect higher bond prices in coming months because they say the Federal Reserve System probably will drive down interest rates in an effort to rejuvenate the economy. But some are having second thoughts, especially as several recent government reports have indicated the economy may be perking up somewhat.</br></br>"I'm continuing to predict that rates will decline for the next several quarters, but I'm much less confident about it than I was in a similar forecast at the end of the summer," said James L. Cochrane, senior vice president at Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. He expects the economy to remain "weak" through the first half of 1987, paving the way for declines of about 1/2 percentage point on 30-year Treasury bond yields to about 7% by this summer.
