Bank's Reporting Under Fire --- SEC, Others Examining Whether Regions Financial Improperly Classified Bad Loans
Federal agencies are examining allegations that Regions Financial Corp. improperly classified loans that went bad during the financial crisis, according to depositions filed as part of a civil lawsuit against the large southeastern U.S. bank.</br></br>The new government inquiries about Regions Financial include subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Regions Chief Financial Officer David Turner said in a July 20 deposition. Another former executive testified on Sept. 17 that the Federal Reserve had deposed him about the bank's practices, and he answered additional questions from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Banking Commission and the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SigTarp, the federal watchdog created to oversee the government's investments in troubled financial companies.</br></br>Regions Financial, SEC, the Federal Reserve, FBI, SigTarp and the Alabama Banking Commission declined to comment. Mr. Turner declined to comment through a Regions spokeswoman.</br></br>The depositions -- unsealed by a federal judge in the company's headquarters city of Birmingham, Ala., earlier this month -- indicate widening U.S. scrutiny of the lender as regulators and federal investigators step up their surveillance of the methods banks use to classify loans or reserve for losses.</br></br>Two transcripts filed earlier this month in a separate civil lawsuit against Bank of America Corp.'s Countrywide Financial unit show the SEC asked employees about the repurchase of defective loans Countrywide sold to investors before the housing bust. Both Bank of America and the SEC declined to comment.
