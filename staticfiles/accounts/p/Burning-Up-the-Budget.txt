Burning Up the Budget
Life is full of little ironies. So also is the Maryland budget. Three years ago, Maryland, like 43 other states, had a deficit driven by the bursting of the dot-com bubble. Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R), then a gubernatorial candidate, accused the outgoing administration of Parris N. Glendening of engaging in a "scorched- earth spending spree." Republicans called the Democratic governor "Parris Spendening."</br></br>But what became of all that "scorched earth" spending? Did Ehrlich reduce "Spendening" spending levels? Hardly. If you accept the doubtful premise that Glendening's spending was "scorched earth," then Ehrlich's spending has reached incendiary levels.</br></br>When he left office, Glendening's final general-fund budget proposal was $10.4 billion. Ehrlich's baseline general-fund budget this year is expected to be $3.2 billion higher than that, an increase of almost one-third in just three years. During this period, Ehrlich has ignored state spending affordability guidelines.</br></br>For years, Republicans in Maryland campaigned on the need to rein in state spending. Since Ronald Reagan was president, it has been a GOP shibboleth that government at all levels is riddled with "waste, fraud and abuse." But after three years in control of the governorship, Ehrlich's budgets implicitly acknowledge that state spending is not easily cut and that governments tend to spend what they take in.</br></br>The initial Republican apologia for Ehrlich's spending will be to blame the Democratic legislature. This is a constitutional impossibility. Maryland's governors enjoy more expansive budget powers than any of the nation's 49 other state chief executives. With limited exception, no state spending can occur without first being proposed by the governor. The biggest exception has been mandated funding, such as the Thornton aid-to-education formula -- and Ehrlich declined to sign or veto that when it was presented to him for reaffirmation.
