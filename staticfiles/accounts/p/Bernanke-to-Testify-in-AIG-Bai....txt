Bernanke to Testify in AIG Bailout Case; Fed Chairman to Give Testimony After He Leaves Post
Outgoing Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will provide testimony after he leaves office in a lawsuit filed against the federal government over the 2008 bailout of American International Group Inc., according to a person involved in the case.</br></br>The lawsuit was filed in 2011 by Starr International Co., run by former longtime AIG Chief Executive Maurice "Hank" Greenberg. Starr, an investment and charitable firm, was AIG's largest shareholder at the time of the government rescue.</br></br>Filed in Federal Claims Court in Washington, D.C., the lawsuit alleges that the government takeover of AIG had elements that were unconstitutional, including that the government took valuable property from Starr and other AIG shareholders without just compensation. Starr is seeking billions in damages.</br></br>Mr. Greenberg's legal team has sought the deposition for months. In October 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Mr. Bernanke didn't have to provide testimony in the lawsuit, at least until his term expires on Jan. 31, 2014. The Federal Circuit ruling overturned a decision made by the lower claims court that Mr. Bernanke should be required to give testimony to attorneys representing Starr International.</br></br>With Mr. Bernanke's departure from the Fed at the end of this month, the team persisted in seeking it.
