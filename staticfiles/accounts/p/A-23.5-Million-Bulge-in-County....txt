A $23.5 Million Bulge in County's Budget; Supervisors May Use Surplus To Resolve Schools Shortfall
The upturn in the area economy has brought Fairfax County millions more in tax revenue than expected, leaving enough money to expand some county programs and to put aside reserves to help balance next year's spending plan.</br></br>County supervisors will decide next month how to budget the extra $23.5 million that has been raised halfway through the fiscal year, most of it from local property and business taxes.</br></br>A plan before the board proposes that $6.25 million of the total be used to help eliminate a shortfall in this year's school system budget and to pay for a long list of items ranging from new playground equipment to flood-prevention work.</br></br>The remaining $17.28 million would be put into a reserve for next year. But even after that money is transferred, county officials say they anticipate a $34 million deficit in the 1996 fiscal year budget, which starts July 1.</br></br>"This will give us a little flexibility to try to face the next fiscal year without gutting programs," said Supervisor Michael R. Frey (R-Sully). "Particularly, it will help us meet the needs of the school system, which is our number one priority."
