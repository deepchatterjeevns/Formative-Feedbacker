Do Job Reviews Work?
Of all the management devices to take hold in the American workplace, none has acquired a firmer grip than the performance review.</br></br>Business school professors extol it. Quality management consultants continually refine it. Corporate leaders such as General Electric Co.'s John F. Welch Jr. and well-regarded politicians such as Vice President Gore embrace it as the key to making all organizations work.</br></br>Yet just as it has reached a level of near universal acceptance in American offices, the performance review - the annual evaluation of an employee's strengths and weaknesses - is encountering a backlash from the ranks of the industrial psychologists and efficiency experts who once considered it indispensable.</br></br>The performance review has spread so far in the 1980s and early 1990s that it is now the rare employee who has not fidgeted in his chair while hearing or reading his working life picked apart. Gore has enshrined the management device by dubbing his effort to reinvent government the National Performance Review, and making improved employee evaluations a key part of it. Corporate leaders are promising to revolutionize the workplace by bringing computers and customers into the performance review process.</br></br>And yet with all this riding on performance reviews, management consultants and psychologists have concluded that the reviews have severe shortcomings. Detailed studies of performance appraisals show that at their best they often are wildly inconsistent and damaging to the loyalty and commitment that help employees do their best.
