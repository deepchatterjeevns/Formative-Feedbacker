Discount Plan for Metro Hops Wins Support for Fare Increase
A proposal to offer discount Metrorail fares for short trips helped persuade Metro board members yesterday to support an average increase in rail and bus fares of 12 percent in June and an additional 6 percent next summer.</br></br>When General Manager David L. Gunn proposed the two-step fare increase last week, the District's representatives on the board objected because the plan would raise Metro's minimum fare for short trips about 18 percent - from 85 cents to $1 - while the cost of longer trips would go up by smaller percentages over two years. The maximum fare would rise from $2.55 to $2.85 on June 30 and to $3.15 in June 1992.</br></br>Gunn added a twist yesterday to his proposal: A special rail farecard for $4.75 that would provide five short rides for 95 cents each. Board members agreed, clearing the way for a final vote on the fare increase by May 2.</br></br>Saving a nickel on trips under three miles would amount to a 12 percent fare increase for those who use the special card. The discount would be available only between June and next summer. The cards would be available at all Metro sales outlets.</br></br>Of 142,000 rail trips taken each day by District residents, about 38 percent are shorter than three miles and would qualify for the discount. Throughout the system, short trips make up about 135,000 of Metro's 520,000 weekday rail trips.
