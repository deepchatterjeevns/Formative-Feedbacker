Consumer Prices Declined 0.3% During April --- Oil Was the Chief Factor; Personal Income Rose, Along With Spending
WASHINGTON -- Falling oil prices fueled a 0.3% drop in the government's consumer price index in April, the third consecutive monthly decline, while personal income and consumer spending rose.</br></br>The decline in the inflation measure followed drops of 0.4% in both March and February, the Labor Department said. Over the three months, the department said, the index declined at an annual rate of 4.3%, the sharpest drop for any such period since the three months ended in January 1949, when the rate was 4.7%. All the figures are seasonally adjusted. The index hadn't fallen for three straight months on a seasonally adjusted basis since January through March 1952.</br></br>Excluding energy prices, however, the index rose 0.4% last month. Energy prices declined 5.8% in April and 6.5% in March.</br></br>"It looks as if it's all oil and that's not to be sneezed at," said Robert Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. But he added that "this windfall is pretty much behind us. The basic underlying inflation rate is still in the 3.5%-4% (annual) range." He said the overall index may show a rise for May.</br></br>Dorothea Otte, assistant director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia State University, said, "The party's over. . . . We've seen the bottom of oil prices."
