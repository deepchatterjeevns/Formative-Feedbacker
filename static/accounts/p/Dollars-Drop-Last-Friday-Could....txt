Dollar's Drop Last Friday Could Signal New Weakness, End of Its Long Climb
NEW YORK -- The dollar's fall on Friday could signal a new bout of weakness for the U.S. currency and -- if it declines much further -- possibly the end of the U.S. currency's long-term climb that began in early 1988.</br></br>"The entire sentiment has changed; the dollar bulls definitely have been shaken," says Jack Kessler, senior vice president in charge of New York foreign-exchange operations for Chase Manhattan Bank.</br></br>He and others cite Friday's plunge in U.S. stock prices and the narrowing difference between interest rates in the U.S. and some of its major trading partners, particularly West Germany and Japan. Many analysts also suspect that the Federal Reserve has begun to reduce interest rates and could go further. Lower interest rates usually diminish a currency's appeal to international investors and speculators.</br></br>By very late in New York on Friday, the dollar had tumbled to 1.8655 West German marks and 141.50 yen -- its lows for the day -- from 1.9083 marks and 144.17 yen on Thursday. The British pound rose to $1.5840 from $1.5523 a day earlier.</br></br>In Tokyo Monday, the dollar opened for trading at 139.30 yen, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 144 yen, and 1.8340 marks down from Friday's close of 1.8720. By late morning, the dollar had recovered somewhat and was trading at 140.90 yen and 1.8535 marks.
