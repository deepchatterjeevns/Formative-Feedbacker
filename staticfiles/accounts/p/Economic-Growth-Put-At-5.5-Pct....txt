Economic Growth Put At 5.5 Pct.; Upbeat Farm Estimate Boosts GNP Figure

Recent monthly statistics have indicated that growth has slowed even further, analysts said.</br></br>The first-quarter report on the gross national product showed the economy churning out goods and services at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.1 trillion. Only 19 years ago, the gross national product was only $1 trillion.</br></br>However, inflation-adjusted consumer and federal government spending grew much less rapidly than in the previous three months, while outlays for housing construction declined.</br></br>The strongest sector was business investment, which rose at a hefty 11.4 percent rate in the first quarter. At the same time, a drop in the trade deficit added to demand for U.S.-made goods and accounted for nearly one-fifth of the total increase in the gross national product, the department said.
