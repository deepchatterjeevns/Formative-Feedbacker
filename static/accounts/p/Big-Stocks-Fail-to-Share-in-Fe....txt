Big Stocks Fail to Share in Feast Lesser Issues Enjoy --- Lack of a Surge Amid Good Signs Puzzles Investors
The buzz word on Wall Street these days is bewilderment.</br></br>Stocks and bonds last week played all sorts of strange games: When bond prices rose stocks fell and when bonds plummeted stocks rallied. Witness the late 30-point surge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday on huge volume even as the Treasury's 30-year bond plunged nearly 7/8 point.</br></br>Even more confusing, however, is the overall weakness of big stocks in the past seven weeks. Small stocks are hitting new highs, but big ones are languishing even though the economy is still chugging along with subdued inflation and corporate earnings still look promising. Of course, interest rates have risen, but by most measures they had declined too much and even after the recent surge are still relatively low.</br></br>"More and more people are saying they're puzzled by what's happening to the stock market," says Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. "They just don't understand it."</br></br>Mr. Johnson worries that investors' confusion could lead to a bear market. What's worse -- and so puzzling -- is that the bear market could occur for no apparent reason, he argues. Though such a prospect seems strange to many analysts and investors, Mr. Johnson says he has found a precedent.
