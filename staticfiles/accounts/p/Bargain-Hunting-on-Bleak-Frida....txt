Bargain Hunting on Bleak Friday; Holiday Shopping in a Downturn: Deals or Nothing at All
There were no Christmas miracles for retailers yesterday as the holiday shopping season officially got underway.</br></br>Pent-up demand could have sent retail sales skyward. Or the economic crisis could have kept them in the red. It was all up to the throngs of shivering shoppers waiting in the dark, cold morning. Would they buy that $598 flat-panel television or a $379.99 Toshiba laptop? "I would describe the customers as hit-and-run shoppers," said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, a consumer behavior research firm. "They went in, they got the deal and they left. If the deal was sold out, they left without anything."</br></br>The day after Thanksgiving -- commonly called Black Friday -- is a key barometer of holiday spending, when retailers traditionally turn a profit. Retailers managed to rouse many shoppers out of bed through aggressive discounts in key categories such as electronics, toys and apparel, but consumers kept a close eye on their own bottom lines.</br></br>Economists are closely watching this holiday season because the depth of the financial slowdown could depend on consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70 percent of the gross domestic product. The next few weeks are also a make-or-break period for retailers because they count on holiday sales to help pay their costs the rest of the year.</br></br>"With the news of the economy, I wasn't certain of what to expect today," said Chris Poleto, general manager of Fair Oaks Mall. He said the 8,000-car parking lot was full by early afternoon and traffic seemed brisk compared with last year. "It seems a little bit more faster and more furious."
