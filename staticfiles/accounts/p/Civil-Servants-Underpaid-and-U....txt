Civil Servants: Underpaid and Unloved
I've been following the recent revelation that federal employees are underpaid by 28.6 percent {"Federal Workers Underpaid by 28.6 Percent, Panel Says," Aug. 23}. Let me tell you, it's true. I know because I work for the government. But I'm not the president, so there's not really a whole lot I can do about it.</br></br>However, I've come up with a solution to the problem that won't infringe on President Bush's promise not to raise taxes, won't increase the budget deficit and won't make a difference in foreign affairs. The answer is simple. Instead of increasing salaries a certain percentage, the difference can be reconciled by decreasing the hours in the work week.</br></br>For example, let's say I make $24,000 a year (I don't, but let's say I do). I work eight hours a day, five days a week. I get half an hour for lunch, so I'm "at work" 8.5 hours a day. Now, in January, with my puny little 3.6 percent cost-of-living adjustment, I'll be earning $25,000. In all fairness, it should be raised to $31,250 to match the same job in the private sector.</br></br>We all know the chances of that happening are nil. That's why we should simply add another day to federal employees' weekends. The figures justify the action. You take 25 percent from the 40-hour work week, and you're left with 30 hours. You divide that by four days and you have a 7.5 hour day. Now, you add an hour for lunch and you have 8.5 hours "at work." The only difference is the three-day weekend. The salaries stay the same, and the increase in the deficit can be blamed on something else. The workers will be happier, better rested and more productive. All at no extra cost to the taxpayers. Who could complain? ERIC B. FERIS Fairfax</br></br>Federal civil servants have no natural constituency and are, therefore, less worthy of a pay raise than retired federal civil servants. Civil servants may expect a 3.6 percent pay increase, while their retired brethren may expect a pay increase well over 4 percent. It all makes perfect nonsense and will be, as it has been heretofore, rationalized to death.
