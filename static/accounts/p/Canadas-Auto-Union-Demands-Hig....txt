Canada's Auto Union Demands Higher Pay from GM Subsidiary
TORONTO -- Canadian Auto Workers President Robert White opened contract talks with the Canadian subsidiary of General Motors Corp. by demanding higher wages and improved protection against inflation.</br></br>The union leader also demanded some guarantees against possible job losses that result from corporate strategic decisions. However, the CAW is more accepting of job losses resulting from a downturn in market conditions, contrary to the United Auto Workers, which is seeking total job security during contract negotiations in the U.S.</br></br>Frederick Curd, GM Canada's vice president and director of personnel, said any wage increase must be tied to improvements in productivity. He said the company was looking for a "moderate settlement" that would help protect GM's market share in Canada. In the first nine months of the 1990 model year, which began last October, GM had 33.9% of the Canadian car market, down from 34.9% in all of 1989.</br></br>Both sides said they hadn't defined how big a wage increase they would consider. Both the Canadian and U.S. union contracts with the Big Three automakers, including GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., expire Sept. 14.</br></br>Mr. Curd said GM Canada also wants more flexible work rules at its plants and improved attendance levels. He said absenteeism, including sick leave and scheduled vacations, currently runs at an average 18.2% of GM's Canadian work force, compared with about 15% at the company's U.S. plants.
