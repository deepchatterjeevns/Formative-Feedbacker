Consumer Prices Increased 0.3% During August --- Retail Sales Climbed 0.2%; Analysts Say Statistics Don't Change Outlook
WASHINGTON -- Retail sales and consumer prices both increased moderately in August.</br></br>The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.2% last month to $173.52 billion. The rise was the latest in a five-month string, but it was slower than the previous four months. Meanwhile, the Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.3% in August, after increasing 0.1% in July and remaining unchanged in June. Excluding food and energy, prices also rose 0.3%, faster than the 0.1% rise in each of the two previous months.</br></br>Analysts said the slight acceleration in consumer prices last month and the slowdown in retail sales don't change their view of the U.S. economy. Prices are pretty well behaved, and consumers seem willing to spend despite their sagging confidence and the slow job market. Still, investors reacted negatively to the economic reports, pushing bond and stock prices lower.</br></br>Richmond Federal Reserve President J. Alfred Broaddus said the consumer price rise in August was "a little bit of a disappointment" given the tiny rise in prices from May through July. But Mr. Broaddus also seemed encouraged by consumer demand, which was strong in the second quarter. He said demand "will continue to rise" unless the job market and incomes weaken.</br></br>"My overall sense is that retail activity is pretty healthy-healthier than employment and, especially, consumer confidence suggests," said Charles Lieberman, director of financial markets research at Chemical Securities Inc. in New York.
