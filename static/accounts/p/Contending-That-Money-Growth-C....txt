Contending That Money Growth Causes Growing Pain
Under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act passed two decades ago, the Federal Reserve is required to set targets for growth of the nation's money supply and explain twice yearly to Congress whether it has hit the targets, and if not, why not.</br></br>In a time of high and rising inflation in the late 1970s, the hope was that the Fed would squeeze money growth, and in the process squeeze out inflation. That's because monetarist economists believed there are strong links between growth of the money supply and growth in the nation's gross domestic product.</br></br>For a number of years beginning in 1979, the Fed focused tightly on money as it sought to reduce inflation. But then the links between money and current-dollar GDP became highly uncertain in the wake of sweeping changes in U.S. financial markets. As a result, the Fed now announces "benchmark" ranges for money growth rather than "targets," and focuses on controlling overnight interest rates to stabilize the economy.</br></br>The Shadow Open Market Committee, peopled by monetarists, this week complained the central bank ought to pay more attention to money growth, and warned that if it isn't curbed by interest rate increases there will be a resurgence of inflation.</br></br>The chart at the right shows part of what the Shadow group is worried about: The measure of money known as M2 grew faster last year than the 1 percent to 5 percent range established at the start of the year. The Fed set a similar range for this year, and so far M2 has increased so rapidly as to stay above the upper limit.
