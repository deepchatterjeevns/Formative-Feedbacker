Barry Washes His Hands Of D.C. Spending Cuts; Control Board Vice Chairman Assails Mayor as `Irrelevant
Mayor Marion Barry said yesterday that he no longer accepts responsibility for making major spending cuts in this year's budget and urged the D.C. financial control board to hurry up and decide how it wants to reduce the city's mounting budget deficit.</br></br>"I've done my share," Barry said in an interview with Washington Post reporters and editors, igniting a harsh reaction from control board officials. "I've done my part. It is now up to the control board. If they tell everybody what to cut, I'll tell everybody what the consequences are."</br></br>Barry's comments came on a day when the city released an audit that documents continued overspending on schools and other city services; apparent violations of procurement and other laws; and problems with government operations, such as computers housed in condemned buildings. The mayor also missed yesterday's deadline to deliver a multi-year financial plan that he said would spell out his vision for transforming city government. Together, the events overshadowed Barry's announcement that he had lowered municipal spending during his first year in office.</br></br>Control board members were angry over Barry's refusal to go beyond his current proposed cuts, which members have described as inadequate. Stephen D. Harlan, the board's vice chairman, called Barry's approach "outrageous" and threatened to slash the mayor's pay and personal budget.</br></br>"It is outrageous that the mayor would abdicate his responsibilities and not provide leadership," Harlan said. "He has become irrelevant, and if he is going to turn over the keys to the city to the control board . . . I think the citizens of this city should know that.
