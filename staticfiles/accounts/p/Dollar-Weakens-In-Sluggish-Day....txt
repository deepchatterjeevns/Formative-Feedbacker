Dollar Weakens In Sluggish Day; Gold Gains $1.30
The U.S. dollar drifted lower against most major foreign currencies yesterday in lackluster trading.</br></br>Uncertainty, more than any other mood, characterized currency markets, traders said. Dealers in the Far East and Europe were unwilling to take a strong stand on the dollar, and instead were waiting for the New York market to open after a three-day holiday weekend.</br></br>But activity in New York was only marginally more lively, as traders had difficulty sifting through conflicting indicators.</br></br>Early in the day in New York, the dollar was pushed briefly upward when traders interpreted the minutes of the October meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee to indicate the Federal Reserve was concerned about a hard landing for the dollar and wouldn't significantly ease monetary policy. Such an easing would lead to lower U.S. interest rates which, in turn, would tend to weaken the dollar. The minutes were released late Friday.</br></br>Then later in Washington, Treasury Secretary James Baker, in remarks before a global-monetary conference, said that the endeavor by the so-called Group of Five -- U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France -- to lower the dollar wasn't "a one-shot" effort. Reacting to the news, one trader at a big British bank said: "Obviously, they're very serious about keeping the dollar down."
