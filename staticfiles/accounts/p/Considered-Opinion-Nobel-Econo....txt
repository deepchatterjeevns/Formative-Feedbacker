Considered Opinion: Nobel Economists See U.S. Muddling Along Without a Slump Soon --- But the Group Notes Danger In Budget and Trade Gaps And Shaky S&L Finances --- Political Gridlock Is Forecast

The panel comprises the 13 surviving American winners of the Nobel Prize in economics (Simon S. Kuznets, the 1971 winner, died in 1985). In the wake of the presidential election, what do the Nobelists, ranging from liberals to conservatives, think now?</br></br>None predict a recession right away. Robert M.
