Consumers Trimmed Spending In April; Drop in Gasoline Sales Was Factor in Decline
Consumer spending dipped in April as shoppers were more concerned about their jobs than the easing of tensions with Iraq, increasing prospects that economic growth will be tepid at best in the second half of the year.</br></br>The Commerce Department reported yesterday that April retail sales fell 0.1 percent from March, when pent-up demand created by February's snow storms helped boost sales 2.3 percent.</br></br>"Consumers are tapped out," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economic officer at Wells Fargo & Co. "They've done a marvelous job of supporting the economy, but they are basically done . . . We need something else to pull up the slack."</br></br>A large portion of the overall sales decline came from consumers spending less on gasoline. Gas purchases fell 5.9 percent from late March to late April as gas prices slid by about a dime on average.</br></br>But shoppers also held back on their purchases of clothing, furniture and garden supplies because of uncertainty about holding on to their jobs or finding new ones, if necessary. The jobless rate is 6 percent today, compared with slightly over 4 percent a year ago. Consumers' hesitancy was a big factor preventing the postwar bounce that economists had expected.
