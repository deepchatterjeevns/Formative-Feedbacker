Authorities Describe 'Lone Wolf'
A series of disappointments--arrests, marital separation and unemployment--beset Jose Pimentel's life before he turned to a radical strain of Islam and, authorities say, began planning a pipe-bombing plot targeting government workers.</br></br>He was arrested twice in two years--once at the age of 19 in New York City on charges of selling marijuana in 2004 and then again in 2005 on charges of using stolen credit-card information to buy a computer, according to court records.</br></br>In 2010, Mr. Pimentel, a Dominican Republic-born U.S. citizen, and his wife separated, said his mother. They have a 4-year-old son.</br></br>And though Mr. Pimentel found work doing odd jobs, he was mostly unemployed for the past several years, said his mother, Carmen Sosa. After moving back in with his mother in 2010, Mr. Pimentel spent most of his time in his bedroom, where authorities say he maintained a website that advocated violence against Americans and followed the teachings of the now-dead al Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki.</br></br>"When I talk to him about what you're doing, he said, 'It's not your business,'" Ms. Sosa, 56, said in a televised interview.
