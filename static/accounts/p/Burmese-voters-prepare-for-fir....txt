Burmese voters prepare for first election in 20 years
BANGKOK - On Sunday, Burmese voters will go to the polls for the first time in 20 years, in accord with the ruling generals' long-held vision of "discipline-flourishing democracy." But exactly what that means for one of Asia's poorest nations is a matter of controversy.</br></br>Win Min, an exiled Burma scholar, says the generals have long used a balance of hope and terror to control the populace and dismisses this month's elections as "purely a time-buying strategy."</br></br>The constitution, which was largely written by the military leaders, is designed to ensure that they remain in control, he says.</br></br>With a quarter of the seats in national and local assemblies to be filled by military appointees, the army will be able to suspend democracy almost at will and will retain a veto on any constitutional changes.</br></br>The junta has also sought to limit voters' choices - 80 percent of the candidates up for election belong to parties broadly aligned with the government. In 153 constituencies, there are no opposition or independent candidates.
