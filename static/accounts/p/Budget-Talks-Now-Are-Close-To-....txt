Budget Talks Now Are Close To Agreement --- Accord Between Congress, Bush on Cutting Deficit Could Come Late Today
WASHINGTON -- After four months of unproductive talks, White House and congressional budget negotiators finally narrowed their differences and say they could reach a deficit-reduction compromise by late today or tomorrow morning.</br></br>"I have been pleased with recent progress, although it has not always seemed so smooth," President Bush said in a televised address to Congress last night.</br></br>"But with or without an agreement from the budget summit, I ask both houses of Congress to allow a straight up-or-down vote on a complete $500 billion deficit reduction package not later than Sept. 28."</br></br>The Republican and Democratic sides are converging on a compromise that would raise taxes about $130 billion net over the next five years -- including an energy tax of some sort, a new tax on luxury goods and higher taxes on alcoholic beverages.</br></br>Defense spending would be cut between $170 billion and $200 billion from projected levels, based on proposals offered by the two sides. Domestic spending of all sorts would be trimmed between $103 billion and $126 billion, with both sides now proposing to make the elderly pay a bigger share of the cost of the rapidly growing Medicare program. Savings on interest costs would account for the balance of the $500 billion package. Even if negotiators agree to cut the deficit $50 billion for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. and the package is enacted, the federal deficit will still approach $200 billion, the White House budget office estimates. As a result, any pact will have to waive the $64 billion deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
