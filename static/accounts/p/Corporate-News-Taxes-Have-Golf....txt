Corporate News: Taxes Have Golfers Teed Off --- Industry in Canada Is Green With Envy Over Write-Offs for Business Expenses
In hockey-mad Canada, the golf industry is fighting for what it sees as its due: a tax break on green fees.</br></br>Unlike the U.S., Canada bars businesspeople from deducting golf-course fees, a policy that dates back four decades, when the government closed tax loopholes deemed to benefit the wealthy disproportionately. Canada does, however, allow people to write off up to 50% of the cost of business entertainment, such as tickets to the opera or hockey games.</br></br>The golf industry says that's unfair. A coalition of golfing associations and owners of the country's 2,300 courses -- including ClubLink Enterprises Ltd., auto-parts magnate Frank Stronach and smaller operators -- said the direct and indirect economic impact of golf spending is 14.3 billion Canadian dollars (US$13.12 billion) a year, or roughly 1% of Canada's gross domestic product.</br></br>About 1.5 million Canadians play golf, according to Statistics Canada, while 1.3 million lace up for recreational ice hockey.</br></br>"It's blatant unfairness in government legislation," said Jeff Calderwood, head of Canada's National Golf Course Owners Association, which commissioned a report on golf's economic impact. The tax rule "imposes a major disadvantage on the golf industry," he said.
