Control Board To Take Lead On D.C. Cuts; Panel Won't Wait for Barry, Will Make Own Fiscal Plan
The D.C. financial control board, moving to exert greater authority over the District government, said yesterday that it would develop its own long-range financial plan for the city after Mayor Marion Barry missed a legal deadline Thursday for presenting a plan of his own.</br></br>John W. Hill Jr., the control board's executive director, said the board had no intention of delaying its work and would begin putting together a comprehensive plan to revive the D.C. government and balance the budget. Board officials have asked the District's independent chief financial officer, Anthony A. Williams, to submit ideas for spending cuts and other changes.</br></br>Barry (D), who said he plans to have his document ready in two weeks, reacted angrily yesterday to accusations that he has become "irrelevant" and has "abdicated" responsibility for running the city. But the mayor's assurances that his plan was forthcoming did not satisfy the board.</br></br>"We are no longer waiting for the mayor," Hill said. "For the first six or seven months {since the control board was appointed}, we have been in the position of deferring to the elected leadership for their ideas. There is tremendous respect for home rule and sensitivity to the fact that the board members were not elected. But there comes a point in time when you just can't wait any longer."</br></br>At a news conference yesterday, Barry lashed out at control board Vice Chairman Stephen D. Harlan, who threatened to cut the mayor's pay and staff after the mayor said he does not plan to propose more major spending cuts this year. Barry said the board has that duty. And, he said, Harlan doesn't understand that poor members of the community cannot endure massive spending reductions that would eliminate a mounting budget deficit.
