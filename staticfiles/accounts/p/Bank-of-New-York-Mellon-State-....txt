Bank of New York Mellon, State Street Net Surge
Bank of New York Mellon Corp.'s fourth-quarter earnings soared as the asset manager and security adviser freed itself of the securities losses that hobbled it in past quarters.</br></br>Meanwhile, State Street Corp. fourth-quarter profit more than doubled as the institutional money-management firm's revenue from servicing and management fees strengthened. The parent of State Street Global Advisors has seen business stabilize but previously warned that results would weaken in the second half of last year because of the slow pace of economic recovery and its trend of collecting fewer transaction fees.</br></br>Bank of New York Mellon, a custodial bank that holds investments and securities for other investors, said total fee revenue jumped 43% to $2.58 billion, while net securities gains were $15 million, after $1.24 billion in losses a year earlier. Net interest revenue fell by a third to $724 million but rose slightly from the previous quarter.</br></br>In the third quarter, the bank, formed in July 2007 when Bank of New York acquired Mellon Financial Corp., sold or restructured billions of dollars in risky investments, a move that hurt its bottom line at the time but set it up for fewer one-time charges or losses. It struggled last year with investment write-downs and securities losses because of troubles at secondary businesses, such as those related to real estate, and ongoing weakness in fee revenue.</br></br>Bank of New York Mellon Chief Executive Robert Kelly said the continuation of low interest rates continued to weigh on net interest and fee revenue. But he noted the company saw "excellent growth" in asset and wealth management revenue during the quarter.
