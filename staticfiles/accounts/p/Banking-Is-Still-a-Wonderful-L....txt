Banking Is Still a Wonderful Life
Most of the big banks are out with their first-quarter profits this week, and once again they are at record levels, as they were for much of last year. (Wachovia's net is up 30 percent, Suntrust's 36 percent and Bank of America's 75 percent from the comparable period last year.) Deposits are up, as are consumer lending and fees from investment banking, while most of the scandals are behind them. Bank stocks are on the rise, as are the annual pay packages of big bank chief executives, which now routinely top $15 million.</br></br>Much of the credit for this improvement in bank economics goes to consolidation and new technology, which have allowed banks to cut a huge chunk of their operating costs. It turns out there were significant scale efficiencies to be gained by combining back offices and branch networks. In addition, ATMs, automatic deposits, online bill paying and computerized loan approvals have allowed banks to shrink payrolls even as they grow their businesses.</br></br>So far, however, there is little evidence that all this new efficiency has benefited consumers in the form of lower fees and higher interest rates on deposits. Whereas in the past, banks were happy with net interest spreads -- roughly speaking, the interest rate difference between what banks pay depositors and what they charge borrowers -- of 2 percentage points, spreads now routinely top 3 percentage points. And fees for things like ATM withdrawals or bounced checks are higher in both absolute terms and as a share of bank profits.</br></br>The numbers for all this are surprisingly difficult to tease out from financial statements and regulatory filings. They bounce around from year to year and bank to bank, complicated by the effect of mergers. But it seems clear from conversations with local bankers that, rather than compete for depositors on the basis of price, banks have decided they are better off competing on the basis of service.</br></br>There are several possible explanations. As in any industry dominated by a handful of major players, price wars are not a very attractive strategy. Any bank that makes the first move to cut fees or raise deposit rates knows all too well that other banks have the wherewithal to match its offer. The resulting stalemate won't change anyone's market share, but it will lower everyone's profits.
