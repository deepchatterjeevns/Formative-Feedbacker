Canadian Dollar Flat After Mixed U.S., Canada Data
The Canadian dollar was mostly unchanged against the U.S. dollar after a mixed round of economic data in the U.S. and Canada.</br></br>The U.S. dollar was at C$1.0154 Thursday morning, from C$1.0159 right before the data and C$1.0161 late Wednesday, according to data provider CQG.</br></br>Canada's economy grew at a 0.2% rate in January, slightly ahead of expectations of a tepid 0.1% pace. The U.S. economy, meanwhile, advanced at a 0.4% annual rate between October and December, revised upward from last month's reading of 0.1% growth.</br></br>The Canadian dollar, which initially edged higher right after the release of the data, returned swiftly to its previous levels shortly afterward. The loonie's brief gains were tempered by a weaker reading of U.S. jobless claims which increased by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 357,000 in the week ended March 23. It was the second week in a row that saw an increase in jobless claims, a possible sign that the U.S.'s labor market may have lost a bit of momentum.</br></br>The Canadian dollar was largely flat in overnight trading, despite a 2.8% fall in China's equity market, a soft German unemployment report and the re-opening of banks in Cyprus, albeit with substantial capital controls in place.
