Aide Says Reagan May Accept Trimming Of Social Security Increases to Cut Deficit
WASHINGTON -- President Reagan might accept the curtailment of Social Security increases as a deficit-cutting measure but won't lead the charge for the change, a senior administration official said.</br></br>The statement represents the first hint that the president might consider retreating from his firm campaign pledge not to scale back Social Security cost-of-living increases.</br></br>True to Mr. Reagan's campaign promise, the official said, the president won't propose any changes in Social Security benefits in his fiscal 1986 budget. The budget plan, which goes to Congress Feb. 4, is likely to be called a freeze. But if altering the Social Security inflation adjustments "is the only way to make the freeze fly," the official added, "he'd at least have to look at it."</br></br>The president's tacit support for such a change mightn't materialize if the Democrats continue to oppose any reduction in Social Security benefits. The president would work against any proposed change, the official said, "unless there was an overwhelming consensus for it in both parties."</br></br>The official's comments reflect the White House's eagerness to encourage congressional spending-cut ideas. The administration has failed so far to produce a budget proposal that shrinks the deficit to targeted levels. Opening the door to Social Security cuts -- a politically risky move -- suggests that the White House plans to rely heavily on Congress to make many of the painful choices needed to narrow the gap between spending and revenue.
