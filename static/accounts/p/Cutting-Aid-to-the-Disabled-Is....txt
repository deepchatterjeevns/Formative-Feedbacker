Cutting Aid to the Disabled Is a Bad Way to Save Money
Kudos to the Journal for getting it right in the article "," page one, May 20). As you wrote, "Logically, states would cut the most expensive, least efficient services and keep the most cost-effective." However, they are doing anything but by targeting home and community-based services for persons with developmental disabilities.</br></br>Leaving aside the inhumanity of targeting such a vulnerable population, it is simply bad fiscal policy. Cutting these services results in adverse situations for the individuals, families and communities involved. When hours for personal-care attendants are cut to levels that no longer allow individuals to live in their own homes, one result is far costlier and undesirable nursing-home care. Additionally, direct-care workers lose jobs, further increasing state unemployment rates and, ironically, adding to Medicaid rolls. Moreover, states forfeit significant federal matching funds for home and community-based services.</br></br>People with cerebral palsy and other developmental disabilities and their families face these tragic problems daily. These are real lives at risk due to misguided state policy.</br></br>Stephen Bennett</br></br>President and Chief Executive
