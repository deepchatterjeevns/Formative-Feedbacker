Correction: A Sept. 24 A-section photo caption incorrectly identified Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson (S.D.) as a Republican. (Published 9/26/2008)</br></br>The Bush administration sent some of its most powerful figures to Capitol Hill yesterday to rally support for a $700 billion plan to revive the U.S. financial system, but they encountered stiff resistance from lawmakers who are deeply skeptical of the proposal and angered by the administration's push for its speedy approval.</br></br>Vice President Cheney, White House Chief of Staff Joshua B. Bolten and other Bush advisers shuttled from meeting to meeting, selling privately to worried lawmakers what Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke pitched publicly at a Senate hearing: a massive bailout for the financial markets. They urged Congress to authorize the plan quickly and without many alterations.</br></br>The issue transcended party lines. Democrats voiced doubts, and many Republicans, particularly in the House, balked at the entreaties from Cheney, Bolten and other officials.</br></br>"Just because God created the world in seven days doesn't mean we have to pass this bill in seven days," Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) said after exiting a two-hour meeting with Cheney.
