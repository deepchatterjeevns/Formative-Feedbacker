A Tale of Two States
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel insists that the city's teacher strike was entirely "avoidable." Maybe so, but he probably would have needed some help from the state.</br></br>Last year Mr. Emanuel importuned state lawmakers to give him the authority to impose a longer school day and year. His wish was their command, but maybe he should have been more careful about what he wished for. The power was useless since he couldn't compel teachers to accept new contracts that didn't pay them commensurately for the extra time. Nor could he implement reforms to teacher tenure, seniority or evaluations without the unions' consent.</br></br>By contrast, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker last year restricted collective bargaining to wages and limited annual raises to the increase in the consumer price index. Had Illinois lawmakers passed similar reforms, Mr. Emanuel wouldn't be in this fix. While unions might still be demanding a 29% raise over the next two years, the mayor wouldn't have to accede to more than 2% annually (he's offered them 4%). He could also require that teachers be evaluated in part on student performance and empower principals to lay off bad teachers and pay exemplary ones more.</br></br>Mr. Emanuel hasn't asked state lawmakers to give him the whip hand presumably because he doesn't want to be attacked for violating teachers' collective bargaining "rights." Last year he assured Chicagoans that he'd "totally reject the approach the governor of Wisconsin has taken" to limit collective bargaining because it was part of "a political agenda." Funny, the unions are saying the same thing about his school reforms.</br></br>The mayor should be getting a first-class education in how public sector collective bargaining works in practice (or rather doesn't work). Politicians are expected to roll over and accept whatever demands the unions make. And if the elected officials dare to ask for "shared sacrifices"--to borrow one of the left's favorite phrases--unions raise hell.
