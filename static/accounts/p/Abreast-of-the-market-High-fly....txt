Abreast of the market: High-flying market still has fuel reserves
The stock market has been on a rocket ride the last seven months, gaining some 22%. But is there enough fuel to keep flying this high?</br></br>Judging by the $5.9 billion that has flowed into equity mutual funds so far this month, there's still plenty of oomph left. And that doesn't include a vast pool of money waiting in what amounts to an untapped storage tank.</br></br>Robert Adler of AMG Data Service, which provided the mutual-fund figures, says it is the largest amount of cash to come into the funds since early January, when investors put in $7 billion. The evidence suggests that interest in investing is widespread, adds Mr. Adler. He points out that of the 10 largest inflows to individual funds, six were into Fidelity funds, which have a large retail component.</br></br>Money is also coming into the market through increased investments by pension funds, through company stock buybacks and individual stock buying.</br></br>Pension-fund figures supplied by Employee Benefit Research Institute also show that more money has gone into stocks in the first quarter this year than in the same period last year. EBRI says $31 billion has gone into stocks in defined-benefit packages, or almost 7% more than last year, and $46 billion, or almost 10% more, in defined-contribution plans.
