China PMI Falls, Points To Need for Stimulus
BEIJING--A preliminary gauge of China's manufacturing activity showed more weakness in June, which appeared to strengthen the case for more stimulus measures to spur growth.</br></br>The HSBC initial, or "flash," measure of manufacturing also foreshadowed weakness in the months ahead as its barometer of new manufacturing orders, particularly export orders, showed further declines amid a lingering global economic slowdown.</br></br>China has already turned to an array of measures to boost growth, speeding up approvals on big projects, offering tax breaks and extending subsidies to promote consumer spending. A big unanswered question is whether the plethora of actions in the past month or so will be sufficient to boost growth during the second half of the year. If so, it could help strengthen global demand at a time when Europe is in recession and the U.S. is growing slowly.</br></br>The HSBC China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 48.1 in June compared with a final reading of 48.4 in May. It was the eighth straight month of a reading below 50, which indicates contraction, though Qu Hongbin, HSBC chief economist for China, noted that the pace of slowdown had eased slightly.</br></br>The drop was mainly driven by a further deterioration in new export orders, which fell by 2.6 points to 45.9 in June--the lowest reading since March 2009. Total new orders also slid to a seven-month low of 46.8 in June compared with 47.9 in May. China's economy slowed to 8.1% in the first quarter of 2012 compared with a year earlier, the slowest pace since the spring of 2009, and a number of analysts are expecting a further decline in the second quarter to roughly 7.5% year-over-year.
