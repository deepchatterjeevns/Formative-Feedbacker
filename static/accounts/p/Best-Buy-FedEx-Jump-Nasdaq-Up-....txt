Best Buy, FedEx Jump; Nasdaq Up for Year
NEW YORK -- "Up for the year to date" is a phrase that nobody in the stock market had heard for a long time. Until Thursday.</br></br>U.S. stocks surged, and the Nasdaq Composite Index burst into positive territory for 2009 as traders ignored signs of rising unemployment and positioned for a recovery, buying economically sensitive stocks such as Research In Motion, Best Buy and FedEx.</br></br>General Motors was the strongest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average as the U.S. government looked likely to give the auto giant another shot at a turnaround. GM surged 42 cents, or 14%, to $3.41.</br></br>Overall, the Dow rose 174.75 points, or 2.25%, to 7924.56, its highest close since Feb. 12, bringing its gains to 21% from the 12-year closing low on March 9. That eclipses a 19% gain between Nov. 20 and Jan. 2 and is the first time the Dow has entered a "technical bull market," a gain of 20% or more since the current bear market began in October 2007.</br></br>The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 18.98, or 2.33%, to 832.86 and is up 23% from its closing low on March 9, rivaling its 24% gain between November and early January.
