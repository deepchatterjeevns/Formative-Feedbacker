Bush Calls Clinton Threat to Auto Jobs; In Michigan, President Cites Democrats' Stand on Fuel Efficiency
President Bush today accused Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton of transforming himself from a threat to the environment into an extremist in support of it, telling a rally that his Democratic rival had become a "bright green" environmentalist whose policies would cost thousands of jobs in the automotive industry.</br></br>Banging his fist on the lectern, Bush attacked a proposal now in Congress - and supported by Clinton and his running mate, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (Tenn.) - to raise automobile fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles per gallon by the year 2001. He said that in Michigan alone "40,000 workers would go from the assembly line to the unemployment line" if the standards were enacted.</br></br>Campaign aides distributed a briefing paper that said the standards would "cost thousands of lives in traffic collisions" because cars would have to be lighter and would jeopardize between 150,000 and 300,000 jobs. The source of the job loss estimate was the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, the trade association for U.S. automakers.</br></br>Bush supports keeping the standards at the current level of 27.5 miles per gallon, a position he hopes will win him votes in this critical state, where the automobile industry has been foundering in recent years and which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.</br></br>Citing reports of Clinton's environmental record in Arkansas, Bush said, "He's gone all the way over from that lousy record now to becoming bright green. He's turned that bright and if Clinton has his way Michigan auto workers are going to be turning green with illness."
