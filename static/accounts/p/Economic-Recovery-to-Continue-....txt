This means the four-year-old economic recovery can keep cruising along.</br></br>The Business Council also said the long-term outlook for the economy could be improved even further if Congress cuts federal spending but avoids the temptation to put the reductions into tax cuts that could add to the federal deficit.</br></br>The executives seemed confident as they listed the evidence that suggests continued good times are ahead.</br></br>"A large majority of members thought monetary policy over the past year has been just about right," said Richard Rosenberg, who runs BankAmerica Corp.
