Barry, Pledging Cooperation, Revises Budget, Cuts Deficit; Mayor Stresses Partnership With D.C. Control Board
Mayor Marion Barry declared a new era yesterday of cooperation with the D.C. financial control board, submitting a revised 1997 budget that makes numerous changes the board had sought and cuts the city's projected budget deficit for the year nearly in half.</br></br>Barry's conciliatory gestures come just days after he and board Chairman Andrew F. Brimmer acknowledged that the District made only limited financial progress during the first year of the board, which was created last April. Barry said the two need to "recommit" to a better working relationship, and his words and actions yesterday emphasized cooperation.</br></br>The mayor said both the control board and the city's chief financial officer, Anthony A. Williams -- with whom Barry has clashed repeatedly -- had helped him improve his budget. "This process so far has demonstrated a new tone of collaboration between the administration and the financial {control board}," Barry (D) said.</br></br>"Their work has been in support of the philosophy and goals of my original proposal. We have worked as a team, and our goal is to produce a single product that can go forward to the {D.C.} council and the Congress with our joint support."</br></br>Barry said it was vital for local officials and control board members to overcome remaining differences before the $5.3 billion budget is submitted to Congress this summer. He wants to borrow more than a half-billion dollars to catch up on overdue bills -- something that will be impossible unless the principals agree.
