OTTAWA -- Canada's gross domestic product rose 3.8% in 1997, led by strong exports to the U.S. and a big increase in business spending on machinery and equipment, said Statistics Canada, a government agency.</br></br>Last year was the sixth consecutive year to show a rise in Canada's GDP, the total value of the nation's output of goods and services.
