Canadian Dollar Slips
TORONTO--The Canadian dollar weakened Tuesday following unexpectedly soft regional manufacturing data from the U.S.</br></br>The Canadian dollar had edged higher in early trading on some solid domestic retail-sales data for May, but the weak U.S. data prompted it to surrender those early gains.</br></br>The U.S. dollar was at C$1.0208 late Tuesday, from C$1.0188 late Monday, according to data provider CQG.</br></br>The Canadian currency and its risk-sensitive fellow travellers, the Australian and New Zealand dollars, all lost ground Tuesday after the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank's reading on central-Atlantic manufacturing in July showed a sharp contraction.</br></br>"Clearly we are in a stressed environment that is, of course, linked to the headline Richmond Fed manufacturing index, as well as the components looking fairly dreadful," said Sebastian Galy, senior currency strategist at Societe Generale in New York.
