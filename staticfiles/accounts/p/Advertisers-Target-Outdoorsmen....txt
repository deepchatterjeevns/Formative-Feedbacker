And they represent just one of the methods being utilized to prod sports nuts back to nature.</br></br>"It's the next Nascar," crows Jason Klein, the president and chief executive officer of Times Mirror Magazines, the newly acquired unit of Tribune Co., that publishes outdoorsy periodicals such as Outdoor Life and Field & Stream. The magazines are a partner in the upcoming sports program.</br></br>With bass-fishing tournaments that feature boats decked out in corporate logos on the rise, his claim may be more than wishful thinking.
