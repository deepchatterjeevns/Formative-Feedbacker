CBO Disputes Bush Promise To Cut Deficit in Half in 5 Years; Budget Analysis Challenges Administration's Forecasts
President Bush's budget would not cut the budget deficit in half over five years, as the president has promised, and would run up $2.75 trillion in additional debt over the next decade, according to an analysis the Congressional Budget Office issued yesterday.</br></br>The report suggests that the administration has given an overly pessimistic view of the deficit this year but overly optimistic forecasts for later years to back up its assertion that the budget deficit could be cut in half within five years.</br></br>Under Bush's forecasts, the deficit is slated to drop from $521 billion this year to $239 billion in 2009, the last year of his projection. By contrast, the CBO says the deficit under Bush's budget policies would be $478 billion this year, and would then fall to $258 billion in 2009, before climbing to $289 billion by 2014.</br></br>The CBO projections indicate that, by 2014, the president's spending and tax cut policies would push the government into a hole $737 billion deeper than if Congress ignored Bush's policy prescriptions.</br></br>The new forecast comes at a sensitive time for the White House and congressional Republicans, who face mounting criticism that the tax cuts and rising spending have turned record budget surpluses into record deficits. House and Senate budget writers have pledged to tackle the deficit more vigorously than the president has, and plan to draft budgets next month that would cut spending deeper than Bush has recommended.
