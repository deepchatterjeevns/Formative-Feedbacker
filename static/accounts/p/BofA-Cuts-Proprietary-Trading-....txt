BofA Cuts Proprietary-Trading Jobs
Author: Dan Fitzpatrick</br></br>Bank of America Corp. is cutting a third of its proprietary-trading-desk staff as it complies with new legislative restrictions on the risks banks can take with their own capital.</br></br>The decision affects as many as 30 traders at Bank of America, said a person familiar with the situation. David Sobotka, who runs the desk, isn't among the people whose positions are being eliminated. The bank is still weighing what to do with the rest of the group, this person said.</br></br>Bank of America's move is the latest example of how Wall Street is scrambling to comply with an aspect of the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law known as the Volcker rule. Named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, the new regulation curtails proprietary trading, private equity and other investments where banks use their own capital, as opposed to bets made on behalf of clients.</br></br>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently decided to close the principal-strategies unit that handles proprietary equities trading for the firm, affecting about 60 positions. Some moved elsewhere within the firm, while others left Goldman for new jobs with private-equity firms and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is exiting from all proprietary trading, having eliminated 20 proprietary commodities traders and moving three other desks to a new alternative-investment-management group housed within the bank's asset-management division.
