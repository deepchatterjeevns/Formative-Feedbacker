Dumping on the Dollar
Everyone has his favorite household remedy. Mom is partial to chicken soup, Uncle Pete prefers a shot of Jack Daniels and over at the National Association of Manufacturers they like to prescribe a weak U.S. dollar.</br></br>With the U.S. trade deficit still large, the weak-dollar boys are back selling their elixir to Congress. Our old friend Jerry Jasinowski, head of NAM, was his typically laid-back self this week, explaining that an "overvalued" dollar "is decimating U.S. manufactured-good exports, artificially stimulating imports and putting hundreds of thousands of American workers out of work." How it managed to cause all of this mayhem while the economy was growing by some 5.8% in the first quarter must constitute a miracle. Either that, or maybe a strong greenback isn't quite the economic disaster he claims.</br></br>The U.S. had a robust currency all throughout the 1990s when times were flush. The same was true for most of the 1980s, though we recall similar moaning about the Reagan dollar. The worst recent decade for U.S. economic policy was the 1970s, when the Nixon and Carter Treasuries decided to take NAM's advice and debase the dollar. Nirvana did not arrive.</br></br>NAM's argument isn't economic policy so much as special pleading. Its members have to cope with rugged foreign competition, and they're looking for some government relief. They figure that the inefficient steelmakers got theirs -- tariffs -- so it's only fair that they now get a similar break. A dollar devaluation would be a kind of universal tariff on imports.</br></br>You'd think Mr. Jasinowski would worry about the company he's keeping here. His allies include the AFL-CIO, that free-market paragon, and in the Senate the likes of Maryland's Paul Sarbanes, who has never met a tax or regulation he didn't like. He's only too happy to flack for NAM when it gives him a chance to whack foreign imports.
