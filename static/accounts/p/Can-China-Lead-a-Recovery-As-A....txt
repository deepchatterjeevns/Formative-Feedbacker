Can China Lead a Recovery?; As American consumers struggle, some look east for a spending spark.
Correction: An Oct. 6 A-section article about China's role in the global economy incorrectly described a Morgan Stanley report on Chinese consumer spending. The report did not say that Chinese consumer spending will exceed U.S. consumer spending by 2018. It said that between now and 2018, Chinese consumers are likely to add more to global consumption than U.S. consumers, and that by 2018, Chinese consumers will be spending 40 percent as much as U.S. consumers, up from 16 percent in 2008.

Now China's thriving economy has made it possible for people like Chen, a 67-year-old semi-retired aerospace industry official, to plop down 1,168 yuan, or $170, for a bottle of liquor at a branch of a French "hypermarket" chain.</br></br>"It's not that expensive for ordinary Chinese people now," he said, adding that he planned to serve Johnnie Walker Green Label to guests he was expecting to share moon cakes with during last weekend's mid-autumn festival.</br></br>"As Chinese society has developed and opened up, people have a better appreciation of imported liquor," said Chen, who used to buy the traditional Chinese stiff drink known as maotai. "When you choose a gift, other people will look at it and if it is brand stuff they will feel respected because you chose it for them."
