A Key Volatility Index That Says 'Buy' May Mean 'Bail'
The stock market's most closely followed volatility index dropped this past week to its lowest level in nearly two years. Some investors who study volatility believe low readings are a bullish indicator for stocks. Historically, the market has tended to rise as volatility falls, and vice versa.</br></br>So the latest numbers are a surefire buy signal, right? Not necessarily. Dig a little deeper and you might even spot a contrarian indicator telling you to sell.</br></br>The Chicago Board Options Exchange's volatility index, or VIX, is a gauge of investor sentiment. But its predictive power is limited to tallies of trades that have been made in the past. "The VIX is an important tool," says Ben Londergan, co-chief executive of Group One Trading. "But it's not the be-all and end-all factor to time your entrances and exits to the market."</br></br>The index, launched in 1993 with data stretching back to 1990, moves up and down depending on the price that investors are paying for options on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. When investors buy bearish options on the S&P, known as puts, the options become more expensive and the VIX moves higher. Conversely, when investors sell those put options on the S&P, the options become less expensive and the VIX moves lower.</br></br>Traders' Expectations
