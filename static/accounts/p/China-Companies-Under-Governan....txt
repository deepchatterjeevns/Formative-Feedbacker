China Companies Under Governance Spotlight
HONG KONG--A surprise profit warning by a meat processor and news of market-misconduct proceedings against a vegetable producer have put listed Chinese companies once again under the corporate-governance spotlight.</br></br>China Yurun Food Group Ltd.'s warning Monday that its third-quarter net profit will be down--in part due to negative publicity involving tainted pork--sent the company's shares tumbling 31% to 7.51 Hong Kong dollars (96 U.S. cents), the lowest close in nearly three years. Also Monday, the Hong Kong government confirmed proceedings against Chaoda Modern Agriculture (Holdings) Ltd. in the Market Misconduct Tribunal, sending its shares down 27% to HK$1.10 before a midafternoon trading suspension.</br></br>Chaoda Modern, which grows and processes fruits and vegetables in China, said trading was suspended ahead of the release of price-sensitive information from the company. It didn't elaborate, and declined comment Monday.</br></br>The charges against Chaoda Modern weren't specified. The tribunal handles civil cases on matters such as insider trading, false trading, price rigging and stock-market manipulation against companies and directors regulated under Hong Kong securities laws.</br></br>Since June, a number of overseas-listed Chinese businesses have faced intense media and investor scrutiny over accounting practices and allegations of impropriety, with trading in several stocks listed in the U.S., Canada and Hong Kong still suspended. Shares in many other listed Chinese companies fell sharply as investors dumped what they considered increasingly risky investments.
