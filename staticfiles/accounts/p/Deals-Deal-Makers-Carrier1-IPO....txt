Deals & Deal Makers: Carrier1 IPO Gains From Europeans' Focus on Telecom
The spotlight in Europe's new-issue stock market is focused almost exclusively on telecommunications-industry offerings, as investors battle for the growing numbers of newly public enterprises.</br></br>Zurich-based Carrier1 International SA became the latest beneficiary of the fervor for telecommunications stocks yesterday, as investors in both Europe and the U.S. fought for a piece of the company's initial public offering. Even after both the size and the price range of the IPO were boosted by the underwriters -- led by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney -- the issue was still about 30 times oversubscribed.</br></br>The IPO of 9.375 million shares was priced at 87 euros a share ($87.27) raising $818.2 million and giving the company a stock-market value of roughly $3.5 billion. The shares priced above the range at which they had been marketed, which already had been boosted from the initial range of between $65 and $75 each. Underwriters have the option to sell an additional 1.4 million shares to help meet the excess demand.</br></br>The company, which is less than two years old, will begin trading today on both the Nasdaq Stock Market and Germany's Neuer Markt, the growth-stock division of the Deutsche Boerse. About a third of the shares were sold to U.S. investors and the remaining two-thirds sold in Europe.</br></br>Carrier1 is just the latest example of how telecommunications companies dominate the financing landscape in Europe. Carrier1 is building a European fiber-optic network.
