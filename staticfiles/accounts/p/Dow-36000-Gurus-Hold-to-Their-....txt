`Dow 36,000' Gurus Hold to Their View Amid Downturn
REMEMBER THE BEST-SELLING book, "Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market"?</br></br>With stocks plunging, and many giddy investors who swore by the book now burning it, the authors must be sheepishly admitting how foolish and wrong they were, right?</br></br>Well, no.</br></br>Even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 24% below where it was when "Dow 36,000" was published in September 1999, the two authors -- financial writer James K. Glassman and economist Kevin A. Hassett -- insist the stock market will prove them right. Someday. They're just not saying when.</br></br>"Oh, yeah, definitely. I'm just not going to give you a date," responds an unapologetic Mr. Glassman, when asked whether Dow 36000 is still on the horizon, even though it topped out, on a closing basis, at 11722.98 on Jan. 14, 2000.
