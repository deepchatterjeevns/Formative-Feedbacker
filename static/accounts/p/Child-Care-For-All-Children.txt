Child Care -For All Children
Whether the question is equality between the races and the sexes or welfare/workfare reform, the flood of middle-class women into the work force or adolescent parenting, economic competitiveness or functional illiteracy, a part of the answer is likely to be: child care.</br></br>Except for a handful of conservatives who see tax-supported day care as an intrusion into the inner sanctum of the family, and a smaller number of futurist philosophers who doubt the wisdom of pushing women out of the home in pursuit of full employment, there is a growing consensus that child care is a critical element in addressing America's economic and educational woes.</br></br>But the move toward consensus has come in such herky-jerky, differently motivated surges that we have neglected to spell out what we want child care to produce or how best to achieve it.</br></br>The women's movement sees the ready availability of day care as crucial to the problem of sexual equity. As long as women are expected to see to the care of their children and produce family income, they cannot hope to achieve on-the-job equality.</br></br>With black women even more likely than their white counterparts to be primary breadwinners, day care has emerged as an important civil rights issue.
