Downturn Made States and Cities More Dependent on Property Taxes
A new analysis shows that cash-strapped state and local governments have increasingly come to depend on property taxes to fill revenue shortfalls as other sources of income soured.</br></br>Though not an unexpected trend during economic downturns, the reliance on property taxes has lasted well beyond the end of the recession of 2001. Economists say it is has been of greater depth, and likely will have more lasting consequences, than it did during prior downturns.</br></br>In good part, that's because the soaring housing market has lifted the median price of single-family homes by 15%, making property taxes attractive to state and municipal governments facing spending increases. Meanwhile, states have grown more reluctant to lift income or sales taxes in recent years for fear of political retribution, economists say. In some cases, they are even prevented from doing so by laws passed during the 1990s boom.</br></br>"The local property tax is one tax the local [authorities] can use to offset declines in state money," says William Fischel, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. "To some extent, if the state is sending municipalities or even school districts less money because they're in fiscally difficult times, the one tax the local [authorities] have some discretion over raising is the property tax."</br></br>Though municipalities can offset rising property values by changing their millage rates, or the rates at which taxes are levied on properties, many strapped municipalities chose not to do so in recent years. "Ultimately, what determines whether property taxes go up is the overall budget for the taxing district," says Matt Gardner, state- tax-policy director with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington, D.C.
