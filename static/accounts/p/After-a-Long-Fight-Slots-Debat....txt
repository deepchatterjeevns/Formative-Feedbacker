After a Long Fight, Slots Debate Might Have Blown Timing
Maryland resisted slot machine gambling for years only to launch a program this month at what could be the worst possible time, leaving state leaders divided about whether to simply ride out the recession or take more aggressive action.</br></br>As it stands, gaming companies are over-leveraged and short on cash. Borrowing money to build slots parlors is difficult with frozen credit markets. And the state has insisted on offering operators one of the lowest shares of revenue in the nation.</br></br>So it is that Maryland has only four bids to operate five slots sites and requests to use only 6,550 of the 15,000 machines that voters authorized in November.</br></br>As they try to regroup, state leaders are weighing whether to offer better deals to operators, lobby current bidders to accept more machines or even change locations where slots are allowed. But there appear to be no easy or quick fixes.</br></br>"If they had done this in 2005 or 2006, they probably would have done fine," said William Eadington, director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada at Reno. But right now, "the whole industry is in a very bad position to be bidding on anything."
