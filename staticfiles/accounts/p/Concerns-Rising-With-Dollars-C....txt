Concerns Rising With Dollar's Continued Fall; Analysts Fear Rates Will Climb, Recovery Will Stall
With the economy expanding smartly, interest rates low and inflation in check, President Bush is sailing into the presidential election year with perhaps only a single dark economic cloud on the horizon: the shrinking U.S. dollar.</br></br>Whether that cloud produces a nourishing rain shower -- in the form of swelling U.S. exports and a recovery of manufacturing jobs - - or a deluge of rising interest rates and soaring budget deficits is the subject of increasingly heated economic debate.</br></br>Recent news of rapid third-quarter economic growth, rising consumer spending and climbing personal incomes did little to budge the dollar from its record lows against the 12-nation euro. The dollar has fallen about one-third against the unified European currency over the past three years -- 15 percent this year alone. In the past 23 months, the dollar has slid 11 percent against all the world's currencies, according to Stephen S. Roach, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley & Co.</br></br>For now, economists say, the decline has on balance been a boon to the U.S. economy, pushing the price of American-made goods and services lower on the international market, stimulating exports while trimming imports. Indeed, the economic forecasting firm Global Insight Inc. has calculated that the dollar's decline has saved as many as 700,000 manufacturing jobs since the slide began in earnest two years ago. And as long as inflation stays low, there will be little pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates from their historic lows.</br></br>But concerns are growing, especially on Wall Street, that the dollar's slide will inevitably drive up long-term interest rates, and some analysts think the decline could even force the Fed to raise the rates it targets. That could slow the nascent economic recovery, swell the already-record federal budget deficit and possibly resurrect an economic problem unseen for nearly 20 years: inflation.
