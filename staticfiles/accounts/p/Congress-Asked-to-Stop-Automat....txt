Congress Asked to Stop Automatic Council Raises; Backlash Over Increases Hits D.C. Officials
An article Thursday about a $20 million pay package approved Tuesday by the D.C. Council incorrectly reported that council member Betty Ann Kane (D-At large) is a lawyer. (Published 11/19/88)</br></br>D.C. Council Chairman David A. Clarke asked Congress yesterday to amend the city charter to prevent the 12 other council members from receiving automatic pay raises every time the salaries of the full-time chairman and the mayor's senior executives are raised.</br></br>The request, which Clarke said he forwarded to Congress after the council approved a motion by John Ray (D-At Large), came one day after the council acted on a $20 million D.C. government pay package that increased the annual salaries of council members to $69,500. Combined with a scheduled raise approved two years ago, the action will mean an increase of as much as $19,000 a year for some members.</br></br>Those increases-triggered in part by the link in the city charter between the salaries of Clarke and other council members-were criticized yesterday by some who fear the increases will exacerbate the District's worsening financial problems. The city has a projected budget deficit of $150 million. Although city officials said the $20 million cost of the pay package was included in the projected deficit, some council members at Tuesday's meeting questioned whether that was indeed the case.</br></br>"I believe that it is important for our council members and other executives to receive competitive compensation," said David Schlien, a vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 6,000 D.C. employees. "However, I am concerned that this is being implemented at a time when the city is facing a deficit."
