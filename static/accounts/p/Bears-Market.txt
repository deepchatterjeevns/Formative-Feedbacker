Bear's Market
Yesterday Wall Street and the government's top financial regulators were in a place they'd rather not be: Wrapped in a bear hug from Congress. Whatever the merits of the case for the Federal Reserve's decision to let J.P. Morgan buy Bear Stearns, the deal raised sufficient and legitimate questions of public interest to justify Senator Chris Dodd and his Senate Banking Committee brethren getting up close and personal with Ben Bernanke and the rest of the boys who did the deal. No one should expect Congress to regard this as a once- only date.</br></br>Details that emerged from the hearing offered a better understanding of the high drama during the days of the sale. These particulars make us inclined to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt on doing the basic deal to forestall systemic risk. We remain unconvinced about the new precedent of the government holding $29 billion in mortgage- related securities as collateral.</br></br>As described, the Fed learned from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday evening March 13 that Bear would have to declare bankruptcy the next morning. That Thursday, according to SEC Chairman Chris Cox, Bear's liquidity dropped to $2 billion from $12 billion. That would focus anyone's mind. Bear's customers and counterparties were accelerating their refusal to deal with the bank. As Mr. Cox summarized: "Run" isn't normally associated with investment banks, but "the analogy is nearly complete."</br></br>At the most basic level of justification -- that Bear's collapse posed a systemic risk to both the financial market and the broader economy -- the regulators made a plausible case for their actions that weekend. But once past this first-order goal, we find much in the testimony to merit concern.</br></br>Exhibit A remains that mammoth guarantee by the Fed to finance billions in illiquid Bear assets. The best face we can put on this decision, based on what was said yesterday, is that the regulators considered the $30 billion to be chump change against the larger, immediate threat to the system. Then as a gesture of mitigation, J.P. Morgan took on the first billion of potential losses from the assets.
