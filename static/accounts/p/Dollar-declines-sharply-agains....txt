Dollar declines sharply against mark, yen as equities drop 3rd time in row
NEW YORK -- A surge in demand for marks and a falling U.S. stock market sent the dollar into a sharp decline against the German currency and the yen yesterday, traders said.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell just over 160 points -- its third fall in a row. The U.S. bond market also was in the doldrums.</br></br>The mark's advance was most prominent against the lira, Sweden's krona and Spain's peseta. Traders said the sense -- mainly a delayed reaction to a Dutch interest-rate rise Friday -- that German official rates have bottomed out sent investors fleeing from currencies of European countries with higher interest rates.</br></br>"The perception in the market is that German rates have hit bottom," said Kevin Lawrie, chief dealer at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "That takes away the attractiveness of other high-yielding currencies," he added.</br></br>Some market participants also said comments by Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, or EMI, supported the mark. The EMI is the precursor to the future European central bank.
