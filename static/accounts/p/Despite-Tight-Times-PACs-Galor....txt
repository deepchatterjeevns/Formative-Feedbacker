Despite Tight Times, PACs Galore
Virginia is a hothouse sprouting PACs this summer. There's a political action committee for nearly every big-name politician and seemingly every cause, solidifying the state's image as the Casbah of campaign cash and oiling the perpetual-motion machine of campaign fundraising.</br></br>Worried about the economically distressed Southside region and its representation in the General Assembly? Donate to the Class of 2002 Southside Leadership Fund, founded in June by three up-and- coming Republican delegates contemplating long careers in Richmond if reelected in 2003.</br></br>Want to help House speaker-designate William J. Howell (R- Stafford) mend a GOP caucus badly bruised by the scandal that ousted S. Vance Wilkins Jr.? Howell is launching his Dominion Leadership Trust with a fundraiser Sept. 16 in Washington, a Virginia Beach event three days later and a breakfast in Richmond the day after that.</br></br>Howell's DLT should not be confused with Wilkins's Dominion Leadership Fund, which churned through more than $680,000 in its short life as the speaker's personal political treasury. He was methodical as the GOP's main money man, carefully screening candidates before bestowing $5,000, $10,000 and more on lucky ones who, once they won election (as most did), owed him their allegiance.</br></br>Wilkins elevated the boutique PAC to a mighty instrument of power, fully on par with several PACs controlled by former Gov. James S. Gilmore III, who worked with Wilkins and the state GOP to build a General Assembly majority. Wilkins and Howell are quarreling over disposition of about $160,000 left in Wilkins's fund.
