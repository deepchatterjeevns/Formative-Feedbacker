China and America: A Profitable Partnership
Forty years ago this week, leaders from the United States and China broke decades of estrangement and ushered in a new era of relations between the two countries. That act of enormous courage and wisdom changed the world forever.</br></br>Now, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of Nixon's historic visit to China, and as Vice President Xi Jinping embarks on an important visit to the U.S., never before has there been such urgency to move the relationship forward to solve the many common challenges we face.</br></br>Today, whether the subject is nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, energy security, climate change, global economic recovery or financial stability, China and the U.S. have a common interest in working together on these and other transnational challenges.</br></br>Yet barriers on both sides prevent the relationship from fully developing. In China, many citizens and leaders question America's commitment to China. In America, nearly 60% of its people say they feel threatened by China's economic progress, according to a recent CBS News/New York Times poll.</br></br>In reality, these concerns overlook the substantial benefits both countries have received as a result of increased economic and trade cooperation.
