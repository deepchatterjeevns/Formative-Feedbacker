Crist Completes His Reinvention
Charlie Crist is the former governor of Florida. When he was governor he was a Republican. Now he's a Democrat and wants his old job back.</br></br>Mr. Crist is expected to kick off his gubernatorial bid on Monday, thereby completing his political reinvention. He left the GOP after sliding more than 20 points in the 2010 Republican Senate primary ultimately won by Marco Rubio. After losing the Senate race as an independent, he cozied up to Democratic fundraisers and party officials. Democrats embraced him notwithstanding the rank opportunism.</br></br>But then, Democrats may have their own cynical motives. Republican Gov. Rick Scott is one of their top targets in next year's midterm elections because of Florida's pivotal status as a presidential swing state. Mr. Scott, whose approval rating has consistently measured in the low 30s, also ranks as one of the country's most vulnerable governors. One reason: the governor's abrasive political style has alienated independents, which make up nearly a quarter of the state's electorate.</br></br>Meantime, polls going back more than a year have suggested that Mr. Crist would have a cake walk if he were to run for his old job as a Democrat. Public Policy Polling's survey last month showed Mr. Crist leading by 12 points with a 24-point advantage among independents. What's more, Democrats have no other standard-bearer with as much statewide name recognition, fundraising prowess or cachet among independents.</br></br>But the race could be a lot closer than the polls suggest. For starters, Mr. Scott can run on the state's robust economic recovery. He can point to the 500,000 jobs that Florida has added during his tenure compared to the 632,000 lost over Mr. Crist's four years in office. Meanwhile, the jobless rate has fallen to 7.0% from 10.9% since he entered office.
