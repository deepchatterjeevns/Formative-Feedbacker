BUSINESS BRIEFING
Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian said he has added $100 million to his funds for buying shares of Ford Motor a day after the automaker abandoned its forecast that it will return to profitability next year.</br></br>Kerkorian may borrow as much as $600 million from Bank of America, an increase from $500 million, according to a regulatory filing by his investment company, Tracinda. Tracinda said last month it bought 100 million shares, or 4.6 percent, and on May 9 it began an offer to buy 20 million more at $8.50 each. That would bring Kerkorian's Ford stake to 5.5 percent.</br></br>He said Ford officials "would be agreeable" to meeting with him. Ford's board has taken a neutral stance on Tracinda's tender offer, which runs through June 9 unless it's extended.</br></br>Investigators at Societe Generale said they suspect a former futures trader had help as he tried to cover up unauthorized positions that led to more than $7 billion worth of losses at the French bank. In two reports, investigators said the bank's management failures and culture of risk-taking were partly to blame for failing to uncover the alleged fraud.</br></br>"The trader's hierarchy, constituting the first level of control, proved deficient in the supervision of his activities," the board of directors said in a statement to shareholders accompanying the reports.
