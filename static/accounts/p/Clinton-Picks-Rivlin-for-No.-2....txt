Clinton Picks Rivlin for No. 2 Fed Job; St. Louis Economist Also Named to Board
President Clinton yesterday nominated White House Budget Director Alice M. Rivlin and St. Louis economist Laurence H. Meyer to fill vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board. As expected, he also called for appointing Alan Greenspan to a third four-year term as Fed chairman.</br></br>Announcing the nominations from the Oval Office, Clinton hailed Rivlin as "one of our nation's foremost experts on how to keep the economy growing" and lauded Meyer for the accuracy of his economic forecasts.</br></br>The nominations mark the end of a long and tempestuous search for candidates for the Fed positions. Clinton earlier said he was seeking Fed appointees who would challenge the view held by many economists -- including Greenspan -- that allowing the economy to grow faster than about 2.2 percent annually would trigger a burst of price increases.</br></br>But economists and investors yesterday doubted that Rivlin -- nominated for the Fed's vice chairmanship -- or Meyer would push such a debate. Many analysts described the two nominees as careful, solidly mainstream figures whose views about the economy do not diverge significantly from the majority of the Greenspan-led board.</br></br>Rivlin is "very judicious," said Charles Schultze, President Jimmy Carter's top economist and for years a colleague of Rivlin's at the Brookings Institution before she joined the Clinton administration in 1993. "She's not going to leap before looking."
