The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 6.083% from 6.127%.</br></br>Medium-term bonds also rose. Ten-year Treasurys, for example, climbed 8/32 to yield 5.927%.</br></br>Bonds tumbled on Friday, after the release of stronger-than-expected economic data. But yesterday some investors saw value in Treasurys.</br></br>"The market was a little bit oversold, and while a small minority of people expect rates to be raised [today], it's still a minority," said Bill Kirby, Prudential Securities' co-head of government trading.
