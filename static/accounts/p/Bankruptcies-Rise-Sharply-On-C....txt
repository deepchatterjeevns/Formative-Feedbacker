Bankruptcies Rise Sharply On Credit Woes
Depressed consumer spending and the global credit crisis created a double-edged sword that drove more than 5,000 businesses into bankruptcy last month, marking a 25% increase since the start of the year.</br></br>The 5,233 new commercial bankruptcy filings in May also represented a 46% increase from May 2007, according to data from Automated Access to Court Electronic Records, or AACER. The filings include businesses seeking to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as well as companies that are liquidating their assets under Chapter 7.</br></br>"The increase is driven by the credit crisis, which started shortly after May 2007," said Stephen J. Lubben, a bankruptcy-law professor at Seton Hall University in Newark, N.J. "Last summer, credit began tightening and it's remained tight ever since, so firms are not able to refinance their way out of trouble anymore."</br></br>More than 8,700 businesses filed for bankruptcy during the first quarter of 2008, according to new federal court data released Tuesday. The 8,713 new filings represented an increase of nearly 39% from the 6,280 companies that filed in the first three months in 2007, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts said.</br></br>Among the more than 5,000 businesses that sought bankruptcy protection last month were home-products retailer Linens 'n Things Inc. and restaurant chain Steakhouse Partners Inc., which joined an expanding list of distressed businesses such as electronic-gadget seller Sharper Image Corp. that depend on consumer spending.
