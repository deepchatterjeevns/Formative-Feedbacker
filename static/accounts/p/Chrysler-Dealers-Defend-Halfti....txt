Chrysler Dealers Defend 'Halftime in America' Ad
Chrysler Group LLC's U.S. dealers swung into action on Wednesday to rebut complaints that the auto maker's emotional Super Bowl ad provided support to President Obama's re-election campaign.</br></br>"We have no doubt that this ad had no political agenda of any kind but rather [was] a statement of fact and hope for the future for all of us and America," the company's National Dealer Council said following an emergency meeting.</br></br>The single airing of the auto maker's "Halftime in America" two-minute commercial on Sunday during the Super Bowl sparked debate from living rooms to dealerships across the country. The controversy boosted viewership with more than five million people viewing the ad on YouTube.</br></br>Oliver Francois, Chrysler's chief marketing officer and architect of the ad, said he finds the controversy perplexing. "It was designed to deliver emotions and I don't think emotions have a party. There was zero political message. It was meant more of a rally cry to get together and what makes us strong is our collective power and not our individual disagreements."</br></br>At issue is whether the ad's intent was to sell cars or to help President Barack Obama in this fall's presidential campaign. His administration provided bailout funding and ushered Chrysler and rival General Motors Co. through a quick bankruptcy protection process in 2009.
