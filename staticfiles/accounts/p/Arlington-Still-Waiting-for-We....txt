Arlington Still Waiting for Westover Library Renovations; Construction Funds Approved in 1998
In November 1998, more than 75 percent of Arlington County voters approved $4 million in bond money to renovate or replace the aging Westover Branch Library.</br></br>As is customary in a county known for communicating with residents, officials appointed a citizen committee, and plans emerged for an elaborate building. The building, a joint project with Arlington schools, would feature a library on the first floor, school offices on the second and an underground parking garage.</br></br>Yet more than five years later, there is no new library, even though the county has already spent $450,000 in design funds. And with the project behind schedule and at least several million dollars over budget, Arlington school officials recently notified the county they were pulling out of the project because they couldn't justify the expense. That has left county officials scrambling to redesign a scaled-down building and stay on a construction schedule that is not even supposed to start until next spring.</br></br>The best-case scenario: a new library sometime in fall 2006 -- a full eight years after voters first went to the polls to approve money for the facility.</br></br>"They have already spent $450,000 on a building they have now figured out they can't afford to build. They might not be quite at square zero, but they are close," said Wayne Kubicki, a member of the county's Fiscal Affairs Advisory Commission who has been tracking the project.
