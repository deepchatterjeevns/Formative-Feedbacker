County to Weigh Taxi Fare Increase; Higher Prices for Gas Prompt Push
For the first time in six years, the Howard County Council will consider an increase in the county's taxi fares, largely because of gasoline prices, which have doubled during that time.</br></br>"As the normal cost of living increases and the price of gas keeps going up, we figured it was time," said Frank Awuah, operations manager of Columbia Cab, the county's largest taxi company, which sought the increase.</br></br>The resolution includes an increase in mileage rates and a first- time gasoline surcharge of 90 cents per trip. Sheila Tolliver, council administrator, said that under the proposed rates, a 10- mile in-county trip would cost $21.94, up from $14.95. A three-mile trip, more typical for most local passengers, would cost $7.32, an increase of $2.37.</br></br>Some passengers and council members said the measure, coming atop the Maryland Transit Administration's proposal to eliminate several bus routes in the area, would further limit public transportation options for residents on fixed incomes. A public hearing on the measure is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. July 18 in the Banneker Room of the George Howard Building, 3430 Courthouse Dr., Ellicott City. A council vote is scheduled for July 28.</br></br>The resolution would keep the fare for the first three-eighths mile at $1.90 and increase it for each additional one-eighth mile from 15 cents to 22 cents. The surcharge for trips outside the county would increase from $2 to $2.50, and the fee for credit card charges of more than $20 would rise from $1 to $2.50. The new fees would apply to all four county taxi companies, although Columbia Cab and Columbia Flyer are the largest by far.
