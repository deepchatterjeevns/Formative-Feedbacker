County Is Becoming More Urban, Survey Says
Loudoun County is changing from a bedroom community to one where people can work where they live, according to new figures released by the county's economic development department.</br></br>"We are able to provide a lot of jobs for our residents, and they don't have to travel that far in the county or even out of the county to get to work," said Larry Rosenstrauch, the department's director. "Now we're becoming more of an urbanized place with a broad range of services and jobs for people. It gives people more family time, more free time and more opportunity to spend their dollars in Loudoun County."</br></br>Rosenstrauch's comments were based on his department's 2003 Growth Summary, a synopsis of demographic and economic trends in the county. The annual analysis is used by residents, businesses and policymakers to evaluate the county's development and to plan for the future.</br></br>The report shows that 5,501 jobs were created in Loudoun last year. The figures echo those recently released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which said Loudoun's job-growth rate of 5.4 percent for the third quarter of 2003 was the second-highest rate of the nation's largest counties and compares with a national decline of 0.4 percent.</br></br>"Some of the people are coming for jobs, and some of the jobs are coming for people," Rosenstrauch said.
