Dow Rallies On, Rising 197.84 --- Gold Flirts With $1,300; Blue Chips Stay On Pace for Best September Since 1939
U.S. stocks got another shot in the arm on Friday, closing out the week with a surge that put the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for the best September in 71 years.</br></br>The Dow leapt 197.84 points, or 1.9%, to 10860.26. The Dow rose 2.4% this week, extending its weekly win streak to four. The benchmark is up 8.4% this month, the best September since a 13.5% rise in 1939. Investors snapped up commodities and the euro, all signs of an increasing tolerance for riskier assets.</br></br>Gold set another record and briefly pierced $1,300 an ounce.</br></br>The day's advances began in Europe, after a strong German business sentiment survey helped reassure investors that the export giant's economic machine was humming. U.S. economic data a few hours later showed companies spending more, helping paint a picture of increasing corporate aggressiveness at a time when the global economy looks to be on the rise.</br></br>"That's what this market needed: solid signals that companies are spending their money, at a time when global demand is intact," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. With the dollar weakening against most other currencies, she said, "that's supportive of export-driven companies."
