Attacks Imperil Postal Service's Fiscal Future
The U.S. Postal Service is reeling from the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the ongoing anthrax scare, with declining mail use and rising costs threatening the financial viability of the venerable institution, according to analysts.</br></br>Mail volume was down 5 percent in September over the same period last year. Revenue in the first three weeks after the attacks was as much as $500 million below forecast. Costs associated with damage to a post office near the World Trade Center are at $63 million and mounting.</br></br>Postal Service officials express faith that the institution will recover, but others say the government-created monopoly is spending money it can ill-afford to increase security, combat the anthrax threat and ensure safe and timely mail delivery. No one knows how much the fear of anthrax-tainted mail will lead to further declines in volume.</br></br>"It's unprecedented," Postal Rate Commission analyst Robert Cohen said. "This was a direct attack using the mail as a weapon. It is making everybody rethink the role of the Postal Service. The rate payer will wind up paying a lot more money for this. What's likely to happen is the debt will keep growing and growing, and, ultimately, it could be up to Congress to bail them out."</br></br>Even before Sept. 11, the Postal Service was expecting a $1.65 billion deficit for fiscal 2001. It had announced it would seek its third rate hike in less than a year. It had cut 21,000 positions. It was $11 billion in debt, fast approaching the $15 billion ceiling set by Congress. It froze most capital projects. Its premier product, Priority Mail, was declining after years of exponential growth.
