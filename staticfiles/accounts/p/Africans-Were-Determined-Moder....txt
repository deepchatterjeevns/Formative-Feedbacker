Africans Were Determined, Moderate To Obtain Document on Debt Assistance
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. -- At the 11th hour, as sleep-short United Nations delegates struggled toward agreement on an approach to Africa's economic crisis Sunday, Algeria rolled a political hand grenade into the meeting hall.</br></br>The Algerians tried to reintroduce the cause of the Polisario guerrillas, who are fighting to create their own nation in North Africa. A similar move had provoked an April walkout by the chief U.S. delegate at the negotiations, Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed. A new American exit, as the Algerians well knew, would have forced the General Assembly session on Africa to end in failure.</br></br>Often in the past, diplomats from developing nations have found it impossible not to support each other's pet political causes. But this time was different. From its planning stages last year, the African nations had been steadfast in their quest for their main goal, an economic-recovery program for their continent.</br></br>It took Senegal's foreign minister, Ibrahima Fall, all of 15 seconds, one delegate remembers, to adopt tactics to quash the Algerian maneuver. The Polisario cause stayed on the sidelines. The U.S. didn't walk out. A final document was drafted.</br></br>If that moment of crisis demonstrated the African nations' determination not to be distracted from their objective by politics, the other cliffhanger as the session came to an end displayed their new-found moderation.
