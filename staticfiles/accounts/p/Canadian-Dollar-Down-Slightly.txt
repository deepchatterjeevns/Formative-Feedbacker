Canadian Dollar Down Slightly
TORONTO--The Canadian dollar is ending modestly lower Friday after recouping earlier losses instigated by weaker-than-expected manufacturing data.</br></br>The U.S. dollar is trading at C$1.0175 Friday from C$1.0156 late Thursday, according to data provider CQG.</br></br>While trading was relatively volatile, with the U.S. dollar sinking to C$1.0136, its lowest level since May 14, at one point, the net effect was to bring it back near Thursday's close and its levels early in the week.</br></br>"We're kind of stuck here. We're closing the week almost where we started," said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank.</br></br>The Canadian dollar lost ground after it was reported that manufacturing sales were down 2.4% from March, much weaker than expected 0.3% monthly rebound in April. But it recovered and edged higher against the greenback in morning trading before surrendering some of those gains.
