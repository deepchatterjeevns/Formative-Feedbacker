Bank of America Vows $750 Billion For Communities
Bank of America Corp., facing community-activist opposition to its $46 billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial Corp., said it will lend and invest $750 billion over 10 years in communities for programs such as affordable housing.</br></br>Some consumer advocates have been against the acquisition because of concerns that Bank of America wouldn't make affordable housing a priority. Opponents of the bank's plan said yesterday the pledge is shy of details such as how much money might be invested in a specific community such as Boston, where FleetBoston is based. Those opponents said they will make their opposition known at public hearings that the Federal Reserve Board has scheduled next week in Boston and San Francisco.</br></br>The Fed extended the original Dec. 19 deadline for public comment to allow for next week's hearings because of opposition from groups that want to ensure that Bank of America, of Charlotte, N.C., commits to lending to low- and moderate-income groups. Still, the acquisition isn't expected to be derailed.</br></br>After what was then NationsBank Corp. agreed to acquire BankAmerica Corp. in 1998, the combined Bank of America pledged to invest $350 billion over 10 years. The bank said yesterday it has completed the fifth year of that pledge. Since 1999, the bank said it has loaned and invested $230 billion in economic-development initiatives. FleetBoston is in the last year of its own five-year, $14.6 billion commitment that ultimately exceeded that amount by about $4 billion.</br></br>The new pledge replaces both of those commitments, but activists want more from the bank.
