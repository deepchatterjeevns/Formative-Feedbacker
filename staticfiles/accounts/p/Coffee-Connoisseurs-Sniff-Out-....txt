Coffee Connoisseurs Sniff Out Cheaper, No-Frills Fix --- Business Is Brisk at 7-Eleven, and McDonald's Seeks a Sip of Java Market, Too; Sales Cool at Caribou and Starbucks
Forget the froth-laden cappuccinos and the double-shot lattes. More people want their coffee without frills and the fancy price tag.</br></br>Companies that cater to customers who want a decent cup of coffee at an affordable price are capitalizing during the economic crisis, while high-end retailers struggle to avoid losing revenue and customers.</br></br>"We try to keep ourselves recession-resistant," said Margaret Chabris, spokeswoman for 7-Eleven, the world's largest convenience-store chain. Coffee is the No. 1 sales category at the company, owned by Japanese retailer Seven & I Holdings Co.</br></br>The company offers coffee from 99 cents to $1.79 for the largest cup. It recently introduced its Brazilian Bold coffee as a response to customers' desire for a stronger coffeehouse blend, Ms. Chabris said.</br></br>Total coffee sales at 7-Eleven in February rose 1.1% from a year earlier. The chain sells an estimated one million cups of coffee a day globally, she said.
